# Wardley Strategy Self-Assessment Tool

## What is this?

The *Strategy Self-Assessment* is an interactive tool designed to help leaders evaluate the applicability and execution readiness of a specific strategy within their own context.

:::info

The tool is specific to each strategy. To use the tool, find a strategy first and scroll down to the *Self-Assessment* section. The tool will be pre-filled with relevant statements for that strategy.

It presents a guided checklist of conditions grouped into two categories:

- **Map Signals**: Signs within your value chain and competitive environment that suggest the strategy is a good fit.
- **Readiness**: Capability and doctrinal readiness to act effectively, based on the foundational principles of good practice but tailored to the specific strategy.

## What is it for?

This tool supports decision-making by making implicit assumptions explicit. Rather than offering abstract criteria, it invites quick structured reflection using signals from both the external landscape and internal maturity.

It helps with:

- Gaining strategic clarity before taking action
- Encouraging dialogue and alignment among stakeholders
- Supporting better judgment under uncertainty

## How to Use It

1. Review each statement under **Map Signals** and **Readiness**.
2. Click on each item to indicate its relevance to your situation:
   - **Green**: This is true in your context.
   - **Amber**: This is partially true or uncertain.
   - **Red**: This does not apply or is false.
3. The tool will score each group and give an overall summary, working out a potential way forward.

Each assessment is private and non-persistent—designed for reflection, not reporting.

## Why this format?

Wardley Mapping emphasises situational awareness and contextual strategy. This component reflects that by offering a fast, frictionless way to assess fit and feasibility—without prescribing answers or requiring exhaustive analysis.

It’s not a substitute for deep expertise, mapping, or leadership judgment. But it offers a useful first-pass lens to guide further discussion or validate an intuitive sense of direction.
