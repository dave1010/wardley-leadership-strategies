# About Wardley Leadership Strategies

This guide is a comprehensive resource for applying strategic plays (gameplays) within the framework of Wardley Mapping.  It builds upon the work of [Simon Wardley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simonwardley/), providing practical guidance on [over 60 business and organizational leadership strategies](/strategies).

Simon Wardley has listed these in his blog post [On 61 different forms of gameplay](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/05/on-61-different-forms-of-gameplay.html) and there are many other sites like [Learn Wardley Mapping](https://learnwardleymapping.com/leadership/) that have lists of these strategies.

## Understanding and Applying Strategic Gameplays

Wardley Mapping provides a visual method for understanding your competitive landscape and anticipating future changes.  This situational awareness, derived from your map, is the first step for effective strategic decision-making. This guide focuses on the **application** of those strategic decisions: the "gameplays" that allow you to achieve your objectives.

This resource offers detailed explanations, real-world examples, and practical advice on selecting and implementing over 60 strategies, including examples such as:

- **[Cooperation](/strategies/accelerators/cooperation):**  Leveraging partnerships to accelerate growth.
- **[Creating Constraints](/strategies/decelerators/creating-constraints):**  Using limitations to drive innovation and focus.
- **[Experimentation](/strategies/attacking/experimentation):**  Rapidly testing new approaches to gain a competitive edge.

The site also includes an interactive [**ðŸš¦ Strategy Assessment Tool**](/about/assessment-tool) for some strategies, allowing you to evaluate the applicability and readiness of a specific strategy within your context.

Use the interactive [**Strategy Navigator**](/strategy-navigator) to combine goals, evolution stages, and organisational pressures into a tailored shortlist of plays. Compare recommended strategies side by side to understand signals, first moves, and watch-outs before committing.

To understand the broader organisational capabilities that enable those plays, explore the [**Strategy Maturity Model**](/about/strategy-maturity-model), which charts how teams progress from ad hoc experimentation to doctrine-led mastery.

Over time it has expanded with dedicated sections on [Climatic Patterns](/climatic-patterns) and [Doctrine](/doctrines). These provide additional context for why a strategy works, but the primary emphasis remains on the gameplays themselves.


## Who is this Guide For?

This guide is designed for leaders, strategists, and anyone involved in making strategic decisions within an organization. A basic understanding of Wardley Mapping principles (value chains, evolution stages) and general business strategy concepts is assumed. This resource is most effective *after* you have:

1. **Mapped your Landscape:**  Created a visual representation of your business environment.
2. **Identified your Context:**  Understood your current position and the forces acting upon you.
3. **Analyzed Evolution:**  Determined the evolutionary stage of the components in your value chain.

:::warning

Strategic gameplays are the **culmination** of the Wardley Mapping process. They represent the actions you take based on your map-derived insights.
As Wardly put it: [without a map you have no strategy](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2013/11/without-map-you-have-no-strategy.html).

:::

As described in [Learn Wardley Mapping](https://learnwardleymapping.com/), effective leadership involves:

> Making strategic decisions based on your **purpose** ("the game"), a description of the competitive **landscape** (the map), the external forces acting on the landscape (**climate**), and the training of your people (**doctrine**).

This guide helps you translate the insights gained from mapping, [climatic patterns](/climatic-patterns) analysis, and [doctrine](/doctrines) into concrete, actionable strategies.
