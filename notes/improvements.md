# Strategy Content Improvement Plan

This document outlines specific tasks for improving the strategy content in `/docs/strategies/`. The review was conducted against the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and the principles in `notes/authoritative-content-writing.md`.

## General / Cross-Cutting Improvements

1.  **Consistency in Front Matter:**
    *   **Standardize Fields:** Many files have additional YAML front matter fields not specified in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (e.g., `ethical_alignment`, `leadership_skills_needed`, `evolution_stage`, `strategic_insight_area`, `when_to_use`, `when_to_avoid`, `core_challenge`). Clarify if these are desired. If so, update `CONTRIBUTING.md` and ensure all strategies include them. If not, remove them for consistency. `cooperation.md` is a good example of a file with many of these.
    *   **`authors` field:** Ensure all strategy documents have an `authors` field, and that the author IDs match `/data/authors/authors.json`. Several are missing this.
    *   **`tags` field:** Review tags for consistency and relevance. `CONTRIBUTING.md` states "Don't tag content with the strategy name, unless it is a parent or very generic strategy." This needs to be checked across all files.

2.  **Assessment Readiness Tool:**
    *   **Presence:** Many strategies are missing the `<Assessment strategyName="...">` component. `CONTRIBUTING.md` says it *should* be present "when appropriate." A consistent decision should be made for each strategy on whether it's appropriate. For a comprehensive review, assume it *is* appropriate for most and note its absence.
    *   **Quality of Questions:** For strategies that *do* have the tool, review `MapSignals` and `Readiness` questions for specificity and relevance as per `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines. Many are generic.
    *   **`<AssessmentToolAdvert>`:** Some files like `cooperation.md` and `industrial-policy.md` use `<AssessmentToolAdvert strategyName="..."/>`. This component is not mentioned in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Clarify its purpose and if it should be used instead of/in addition to the full `<Assessment>` component. For this review, I'll assume the full component is preferred.

3.  **Wardley Quotes:**
    *   Ensure each strategy has a relevant quote from Simon Wardley, correctly attributed.
    *   If Wardley hasn't explicitly mentioned the strategy, the note "isn't explicitly mentioned in his [On 61 different forms of gameplay](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/05/on-61-different-forms-of-gameplay.html)" should be present, as seen in `circling-and-probing.md` and `refactoring.md`. Many are missing this note where applicable.

4.  **Section Consistency and Completeness (per `CONTRIBUTING.md`):**
    *   **Mandatory Sections:** Systematically check if all strategies include all 15 specified sections, from "ü§î **Explanation**" to "üìö **Further Reading & References**". Many are missing several.
    *   **Subsection Structure:** Within "ü§î **Explanation**", ensure "What is `<strategy name>`?" is present. Other suggested subsections (Why use, How to use, Types, etc.) should be considered for completeness.
    *   **"üéØ Leadership":** Ensure "Core challenge," "Key leadership skills required," and "Ethical considerations" subsections are present and adequately developed. "Ethical considerations" is frequently missing or underdeveloped.
    *   **"üß† Strategic Insights":** This section needs particular attention. `CONTRIBUTING.md` emphasizes "expert insights that are related to the specific strategy. Not just a vague idea or summary." Many are generic or too brief. These should be expanded based on the principles in `notes/authoritative-content-writing.md`.
    *   **"‚ùì Key Questions to Ask":** Ensure questions are "thought-provoking and directly assist users in applying the strategy." Many are generic.
    *   **"üîÄ Related Strategies" & "‚õÖ Relevant Climatic Patterns":** Ensure these are populated with relevant links and explanations as per the format in `CONTRIBUTING.md`. The `rel:` or context description is often missing.

5.  **Content Quality (per `authoritative-content-writing.md`):**
    *   **Insight, Depth, Breadth, Simplicity, Relevance:** Review content in all sections against these pillars. Many explanations are superficial. "Strategic Insights" often lack true insight.
    *   **Real-World Examples:** Aim for 2-4 specific examples. If hypothetical, clearly state it. Failed examples are good. Many strategies have too few, too generic, or only hypothetical examples.
    *   **Actionability:** "How to Execute" should be a clear, step-by-step guide. "Measuring Success" should list specific, indicative metrics. These sections are often too vague.

6.  **Formatting and Style:**
    *   **Headings:** Ensure H2s (`##`) are bold with an emoji, and other headings are not, as per `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    *   **Lists:** Use `- ` for unordered lists. Ensure 1 empty line before and after lists.
    *   **Mermaid Diagrams:** Ensure diagrams are relevant, captioned if complex, and potentially referenced in the text. Some diagrams are present without context. Check for `mermaid` code blocks that are not rendering (e.g. `quadrantChart` in `cooperation.md` is not standard Mermaid).

7.  **Cross-Strategy Consistency:**
    *   Review related strategies (e.g., all "Attacking" strategies) for consistent depth and terminology.
    *   Ensure that if Strategy A links to Strategy B, the description of how they relate is consistent in both directions if Strategy B also links back to A.

8.  **Review "Note" Usage:**
    *   Several strategies use `:::note ... :::` blocks (e.g., `circling-and-probing.md`, `refactoring.md`, `lobbying.md`, `press-release-process.md`, `playing-both-sides.md`, `last-man-standing.md`, `platform-envelopment.md`). Ensure these are used appropriately and consistently, perhaps for disclaimers about Wardley's explicit mention or for differentiating related concepts.

## Specific Strategy Improvements

The following sections detail improvements for each strategy file, grouped by category.

---
### Positional Strategies
---

#### `docs/strategies/positional/weak-signal-horizon/index.md`
*   **Front Matter:** Missing `authors` (present in file, but not in `CONTRIBUTING.md` example style). Consider adding other common FM fields if standardized (e.g. `evolution_stage`).
*   **Assessment Tool:** Present, seems reasonable.
*   **Explanation:**
    *   "What is Weak Signal (Horizon)?" is okay.
    *   "Why use Weak Signal (Horizon)?" and "How to use Weak Signal (Horizon)?" are brief. Could expand on the strategic rationale and practical application steps.
*   **Real-World Examples:** Good examples provided.
*   **Leadership:** "Ethical considerations" is brief. Could elaborate on potential misuse of foresight (e.g., insider trading parallels, creating panic).
*   **How to Execute:** Reasonable, but could be more step-by-step for someone new to the concept.

*   **Front Matter:** Missing `authors`. Consider other FM fields.
*   **Assessment Tool:** Present, seems reasonable.

*   **How to Execute:** Good, actionable steps.
*   **Measuring Success:** Good list.
