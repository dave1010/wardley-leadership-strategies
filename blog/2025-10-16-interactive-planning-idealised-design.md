**Russell Ackoff's [interactive planning](https://www.ida.liu.se/~steho87/und/htdd01/AckoffGuidetoIdealizedRedesign.pdf) and Wardley Mapping both ask leaders to design the future, not just forecast it; together they give teams the narrative, visual, and gameplay tools to make that future inevitable.** Idealised design sketches the destination, while maps expose the terrain we must cross and the moves that will get us there.

## Interactive planning reframes how we plan

Ackoff argued that most organisations lurch between three unhelpful postures: *reactive* (fix yesterday's pain), *inactive* (assume tomorrow looks like today), and *preactive* (predict trends and hope). Interactive planning rejects all three. It invites everyone affected by the system to co-design a desirable future that is technologically feasible, then to iteratively work backwards to the present.

The methodology runs through six entwined phases:

1. **Formulating the mess** – develop a shared, multi-perspective understanding of how the current system performs, where it fails, and what external forces shape it.
2. **Ends planning** – conduct an idealised design exercise: imagine the system was destroyed overnight and you could rebuild it from scratch today. What purpose would it serve? Which user needs would it prioritise? What principles would govern it?
3. **Means planning** – identify the major capability changes, policies, and initiatives required to move from the current reality toward the ideal design.
4. **Resource planning** – determine the financial, human, and technological investment required and how to sequence it.
5. **Implementation and control** – design feedback loops so that execution can learn and adjust continuously.
6. **Continuous replanning** – revisit the plan frequently; interactive planning is a living practice, not an annual ritual.

Because the work is participative and democratic, the plan becomes the group's shared story of the future. That social contract is the real fuel for change.

## Wardley Maps make the mess and the ideal visible

Wardley Maps complement each phase by externalising assumptions into a landscape:

- **Formulating the mess** becomes a mapping exercise where teams anchor user needs and the components that fulfil them, revealing bottlenecks, inertia, duplicated effort, and dependency risks.
- **Ends planning** translates the idealised design into a future-state map. You can redraw the value chain as it *should* look, showing which components vanish, which evolve, and which new needs or practices appear.
- **Means planning** transforms the delta between present and future maps into a portfolio of gameplay: doctrine to industrialise utilities, climatic awareness to time market entries, and context-specific moves to unseat competitors or accelerate adoption.
- **Resource planning** inherits the map's component-level clarity to size investments, decide build-versus-buy options, and choose where to apply partnerships or platform plays.
- **Implementation and control** use maps as living artefacts. As components evolve or new intelligence arrives, teams update the map and revisit the plan, keeping the entire practice interactive.

In short: interactive planning tells us *why* and *who* should design the future; Wardley Mapping illustrates *what* that future looks like and *how* to traverse the terrain.

## Worked example: rebuilding a telehealth service

Imagine a national health provider whose telehealth service buckled under a surge in demand. Leadership convenes clinicians, operations staff, patient advocates, and technology teams for an interactive planning sprint.

1. **Formulating the mess with maps** – Participants create a current-state Wardley Map anchored on the user need "receive timely clinical advice". The map highlights legacy call-centre infrastructure (utility stage but brittle), manual triage scripts (custom-built product), and missing components such as asynchronous messaging or AI-assisted triage. Inertia notes flag regulatory compliance delays and clinician burnout.
2. **Ends planning through idealised design** – The group suspends constraints and sketches the telehealth system they'd build today. The future-state map features self-service symptom checkers (product edging toward utility), AI-supported triage (evolving from genesis experiments to reliable product), integrated electronic health records (utility), and redesigned practices for clinician scheduling and escalation.
3. **Means planning as gameplay selection** – Comparing maps exposes the gap. Leadership sequences plays: accelerate commoditisation of call routing via cloud utilities, run discovery work on AI triage (pioneer gameplay), and partner with a regulated identity provider to satisfy compliance sooner. Climatic pattern awareness shapes timing—e.g., "market evolution eats bespoke triage" warns them to automate before a challenger does.
4. **Resource planning** – With the value chain explicit, the team sizes investment: redeploying 20% of call-centre staff into digital onboarding, securing funding for AI safety validation, and negotiating capacity with cloud vendors.
5. **Implementation and control** – Delivery teams maintain both maps, updating component evolution each fortnight. When AI triage proves viable, the map signals a doctrinal shift: standardise training, codify feedback loops, and scale the utility across regions.

The result is not a static roadmap but a living system: the map acts as the control surface for the idealised design, and the interactive planning cadence ensures every stakeholder stays engaged as the terrain shifts.

## Making the combination a leadership habit

To embed the practice:

- **Co-design maps in workshops** – Interactive planning thrives on participation. Facilitate sessions where stakeholders co-create current and ideal maps, capturing assumptions and disagreements in real time.
- **Publish both maps and narrative** – Document the story linking the mess, the ideal, and the chosen gameplay. Make it accessible so new team members can orient quickly.
- **Revisit quarterly at minimum** – Schedule replanning sessions where teams refresh intelligence, re-run critical gameplay choices, and retire components that no longer differentiate.
- **Measure learning velocity** – Track how fast components move along the evolution axis compared with expectations. Deviations become triggers for new interactive planning cycles.

Wardley Mapping gives interactive planning its cartography; interactive planning gives Wardley Mapping its social contract. Together they help leadership design futures worth committing to—and then navigate the journey with confidence.
