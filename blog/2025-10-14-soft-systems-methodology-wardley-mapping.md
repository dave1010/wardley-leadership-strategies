**Pairing [Soft Systems Methodology](/terms/soft-systems-methodology)—Peter Checkland’s approach for exploring messy situations through multiple worldviews—with Wardley Mapping gives leaders a disciplined way to explore messy situations, negotiate a shared worldview, and only then convert that clarity into the structure of a map.** SSM holds space for contested narratives and hidden assumptions, while Wardley Maps translate the agreed purpose into visible components, evolution, and gameplay. Together they form a loop: learn the situation, model purposeful change, map what must exist, then test doctrine and plays against reality.

## Why bring SSM into Wardley Mapping work?

Wardley Maps excel when the team already agrees on who the users are, which needs matter, and what value chain delivers them. In the early stages of shaping a strategy, however, stakeholders often disagree on the nature of the problem, the scope of the system, or which constraints really bite. That ambiguity creates churn during mapping sessions: conversations stall over terminology, politically sensitive components are hidden, and the map fractures into multiple conflicting views.

Peter Checkland's Soft Systems Methodology treats that ambiguity as the work. It invites multiple perspectives, surfaces clashing worldviews, and builds conceptual models that describe how a purposeful system could operate under each worldview. Once participants compare those models with the actual situation, they negotiate feasible, desirable changes. Only after this learning cycle does a Wardley Map stand a chance of representing the landscape everyone is prepared to act upon.

In practice SSM provides three benefits before you draw the first axis:

1. **Shared context:** Rich pictures and interviews create a narrative that reveals user needs, conflicts, and environmental factors without forcing agreement too early.
2. **Purposeful boundaries:** CATWOE root definitions describe what "the system" is for, who benefits or suffers, and what constraints matter. That gives Wardley Mapping a clear customer, need, and owner to anchor.
3. **Change hypotheses:** Conceptual activity models expose which transformations might improve the situation. They seed the components you expect to see on the map and highlight where doctrine will be tested.

## Running the combined loop

Treat SSM and Wardley Mapping as alternating passes between messy reality and structured strategy.

### 1. Enter the situation with SSM tools

Begin with interviews, observations, and document reviews. Encourage stakeholders to sketch rich pictures that capture actors, information flows, tensions, and external pressures. Do not worry yet about the axes of a map; the goal is to surface the divergent stories about what is happening and why it matters.

### 2. Draft root definitions with CATWOE

For each perspective uncovered, work with the group to write a root definition that captures the purposeful system they believe would address the situation. Explicitly note the **Customers**, **Actors**, **Transformation**, **Worldview**, **Owner**, and **Environmental constraints**. These statements act as hypotheses about the system you will later map: they tell you whose needs to prioritise and which constraints the map must respect.

### 3. Build conceptual activity models

Translate each root definition into a short conceptual model—five to seven activities that would have to occur if that worldview were real. These are not flowcharts of the current organisation; they are idealised descriptions of how the purposeful system would operate. Compare the models with reality, highlight gaps, and discuss which changes feel both desirable and culturally feasible.

### 4. Switch to Wardley Mapping when purpose stabilises

Once the group converges on a shared—or at least negotiated—purpose, summarise the agreed users, needs, and transformation activities. Use that material as the north star for your Wardley Map. The components in the conceptual models provide initial candidates for the value chain. Their placement along the evolution axis emerges from the evidence surfaced during SSM conversations: Which components are bespoke experiments? Which are already commodities or utilities you depend upon? Which components trigger political tension because they challenge someone’s worldview?

### 5. Feed map insights back into SSM discussions

After drafting the map, return to the SSM loop. Ask: Does the map honour the root definitions? Are any CATWOE elements missing? Do the conceptual models suggest doctrine or gameplay you have ignored? Iterate between map adjustments and SSM debate until the team believes the map represents both the situational reality and the purposeful change they desire.

## Complementary strengths

| Aspect | Soft Systems Methodology | Wardley Mapping | Combined effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Problem definition** | Embraces multiple, conflicting problem framings and legitimises them through rich pictures and discussion. | Assumes a coherent description of users and needs to anchor the map. | SSM clarifies the problem space so the map reflects negotiated intent rather than the loudest voice. |
| **Stakeholder alignment** | Facilitates dialogue, making underlying worldviews explicit through CATWOE. | Visualises dependencies and inertia, encouraging evidence-based debate. | Together they align both narrative and structural understanding. |
| **Action design** | Conceptual activity models explore how purposeful systems might operate. | Doctrine and climatic patterns highlight plays appropriate to component evolution. | Conceptual models inform which doctrinal moves to test; the map shows where to act. |
| **Learning loops** | Iterative comparison between models and reality surfaces feasible changes. | Mapping sessions reveal component evolution, inertia, and competitive pressure. | Alternating between them builds a learning system that updates both worldview and landscape. |

## When to lead with SSM, when to lead with mapping

- **High ambiguity, low agreement:** Start with SSM. When teams cannot agree on the purpose of a transformation or argue over the definition of "the user", stay in the rich-picture and root-definition phases until you have language everyone accepts.
- **Clear purpose, unclear landscape:** Start with mapping. If the problem statement is stable but you lack visibility into components, evolution, or competitor posture, draw the map first and use SSM later to explore contested governance or adoption challenges.
- **Complex ecosystems:** Use both. Multi-party ecosystems (public services, supply chains, cross-sector partnerships) benefit from SSM's ability to legitimize different worldviews. Once you have at least a shared transformation goal, Wardley Mapping exposes leverage points and highlights where cooperation, standards, or managed inertia will matter.

## Practical facilitation tips

- **Stage the workshops:** Run an SSM session focused on rich pictures and CATWOE before a mapping workshop. Share outputs in advance so participants arrive ready to place components rather than argue over terminology.
- **Annotate the map with SSM insights:** Mark components with the worldview or stakeholder that values them most. This preserves the plurality that SSM surfaced and reminds teams whose needs are at stake during gameplay discussions.
- **Use conceptual activities as map anchors:** Each activity in the conceptual model should appear on the map as a component or capability. If it does not, challenge whether the map is missing a critical element or whether the activity is out of scope.
- **Treat doctrine as hypotheses:** SSM surfaces what each worldview believes should happen. Translate those beliefs into doctrinal bets on the map (e.g., "Do we need to standardise this component to reduce conflict?") and capture metrics to test them.
- **Keep the loop alive:** After decisions are made, revisit the rich pictures and root definitions. Did the landscape evolve in ways that invalidate the agreed worldview? Update both the SSM artefacts and the map to maintain alignment.

## Example: Modernising hospital discharge coordination

1. **SSM exploration:** Interviews with clinicians, social workers, and community partners produce a rich picture showing fragmented information flows, policy constraints, and patient anxiety. CATWOE reveals two competing worldviews: one prioritises throughput (freeing beds quickly), the other emphasises safe transitions into community care.
2. **Conceptual models:** The throughput worldview emphasises a system that triages patients, automates discharge tasks, and escalates delays. The safe-transition worldview focuses on patient consent, social support assessments, and feedback loops with community providers.
3. **Negotiated change:** Stakeholders agree that safe transitions must be the dominant worldview, but they adopt throughput techniques to detect bottlenecks.
4. **Wardley Map:** Components include patient needs, discharge coordination platforms, community care networks, transport services, and regulatory reporting utilities. Evolution placement shows hospital scheduling tools moving toward commodity SaaS, while community integration remains custom.
5. **Strategic plays:** Doctrine choices include "Focus on user needs" (patients), "Manage inertia" (clinical workflows), and "Use standards" for data exchange. The map highlights an opportunity to invest in productising community integration APIs—an idea seeded by the conceptual model. Feedback from implementation loops back into the SSM artefacts, refining both worldviews as policy shifts occur.

## Leadership takeaways

- **SSM lowers resistance:** By legitimising different worldviews before mapping, leaders reduce the defensiveness that often derails Wardley Mapping sessions.
- **Mapping accelerates commitment:** Once purpose is aligned, the visual clarity of the map accelerates decisions about investment, partnership, and doctrine.
- **Combined cadence becomes strategic muscle:** Regularly alternating between SSM inquiry and mapping builds an organisational habit of sensemaking before gameplay, leading to more resilient strategies and a healthier culture of change.

Leaders who master both tools can guide teams from confusion to coherent action: understanding the social system they are trying to change, visualising the landscape that change must traverse, and picking plays with confidence.
