# Use a common language

Using a "common language" in the context of Wardley Mapping means establishing a shared, unambiguous way of describing and discussing strategy, primarily through the use of maps. When everyone in an organization is trained to create, read, and interpret Wardley Maps, it removes ambiguity and enables effective communication about the strategic landscape, proposed changes, and potential challenges.

This shared understanding is crucial because it allows for more effective collaboration and faster, more informed decision-making. Without a common language like Wardley Mapping, discussions about strategy can become muddled by differing assumptions, terminology, and mental models. Maps provide a visual and structured format that ensures everyone is looking at the same picture, facilitating clearer dialogue and a more cohesive strategic execution.
