Wardley frames "Think big" as the deliberate act of tackling the whole service, not just the nearest project. The doctrine asks leaders to articulate an ambitious, user-centred direction and to use maps to connect individual initiatives to that bigger shift. When the strategic horizon is expansive, delivery teams can coordinate around a shared transformation rather than chasing disconnected optimisations.

## Why this doctrine matters

- **Ambition aligns investment.** An explicit north star helps teams evaluate proposals by the magnitude of user outcomes they unlock rather than local efficiency wins.
- **Systemic change needs a wide lens.** Mapping the entire value chain exposes duplication, policy constraints, and ecosystem partners that single-project thinking misses.
- **Bold intent attracts support.** A clear, inspiring direction mobilises political, financial, and community capital needed to overcome inertia.

## Practices to embed

1. **Map the whole service journey.** Start with the citizen or customer outcome and trace every component, policy, and supplier involved so the full scope is visible.
2. **Set direction statements, not solution mandates.** Describe the transformed experience and measurable benefits, leaving teams room to experiment with how to achieve them.
3. **Create a doctrine-backed portfolio.** Group initiatives by how they move components along the evolution curve and check that, together, they deliver the promised step change.
4. **Broadcast progress in narrative form.** Tie updates to the original map and vision so stakeholders understand how incremental wins accumulate toward the bigger ambition.

## Watch for anti-patterns

- Declaring a grand vision without grounding it in maps or user evidence, creating aspiration theatre.
- Treating "think big" as justification for mega-programmes that collapse under their own complexity.
- Ignoring the supporting ecosystems and policy levers that must shift for the ambition to stick.

## Questions to ask

- **Which user outcomes improve dramatically if we succeed, and how will we measure that improvement?**
- **What components or policies are missing from our current map that block the ambition?**
- **Where do we need new partnerships or standards to scale the change beyond one team?**
- **How will we keep the story of the direction alive when delivery pressure mounts?**

Thinking big is not about writing bigger cheques; it is about holding a compelling, map-informed vision that gives every small experiment purpose. By pairing ambition with situational awareness, organisations avoid incrementalism and make bold moves that matter.
