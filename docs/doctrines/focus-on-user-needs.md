Focusing on user needs means grounding every strategic choice in a clear understanding of who the real users are, what outcomes they need, and how they experience the current value chain. Wardley Mapping reinforces this discipline by forcing leaders to articulate user needs as the anchor for every component on the map.

## Why this doctrine matters

- **User needs anchor the map.** Without explicit needs, maps drift toward internal projects and politics rather than real demand.
- **Signals surface earlier.** Continual contact with users reveals when needs evolve or when competitors create better experiences.
- **Execution stays aligned.** When teams revisit user needs before committing to action, they prevent automation or optimisation that adds friction.

## Practices to embed

1. **Name the primary users on every map.** Capture the people or systems consuming value and the outcome they care about.
2. **Trace needs through the value chain.** Ensure each component exists because it satisfies a user outcome, not an internal preference.
3. **Test assumptions with real users.** Regular interviews, telemetry review, and shadowing validate that stated needs remain accurate.
4. **Prioritise by user impact.** When deciding between investment options, choose the work that removes the greatest constraint on user outcomes.

## Watch for anti-patterns

- Treating stakeholders or governance bodies as the "user" when the real end user is different.
- Describing needs as solution features ("mobile app") instead of desired outcomes ("manage accounts while travelling").
- Freezing user research after launch rather than revisiting it as the landscape evolves.

## Questions to ask

- **Who exactly is the user and what job are they trying to complete?**
- **Which parts of the map exist solely because they improve that outcome?**
- **What signals tell us the user's needs have changed?**
- **Where are we forcing users to compensate for our organisational structure?**

Keeping the doctrine visible ensures strategy conversations stay anchored in the people experiencing the service. That discipline protects teams from automating the wrong thing and keeps delivery connected to real-world outcomes.
