When Wardley urges leaders to "Be pragmatic", he is cautioning against ideology. No doctrine, sourcing model, or delivery method fits every component on the map. Pragmatism means meeting the landscape where it is—sweating existing assets, sequencing change sensibly, and making trade-offs that keep momentum without abandoning the destination.

## Why this doctrine matters

- **Context beats purity.** Pragmatic choices respect regulatory, technical, or cultural constraints while still nudging the system toward the target state.
- **Compromise builds allies.** Allowing limited exceptions or transitional paths reduces resistance from teams who must keep today’s services running.
- **Realism protects credibility.** Leaders who acknowledge constraints are trusted more than those who promise transformations disconnected from reality.

## Practices to embed

1. **Map transition states explicitly.** Show how components evolve over time, including interim interfaces or hybrid sourcing that keep services stable.
2. **Differentiate policies from principles.** Decide which doctrines are non-negotiable (e.g., focus on user needs) and where local tailoring is acceptable.
3. **Maintain a legacy stewardship plan.** Document how existing systems will be maintained, modernised, or retired so operational teams are not left exposed.
4. **Use data to revisit compromises.** Set review points where exceptions expire unless evidence proves they still make sense.

## Watch for anti-patterns

- Enforcing a one-size-fits-all approach that ignores the evolution stage of components.
- Confusing pragmatism with indecision, allowing every team to claim special circumstances indefinitely.
- Hiding behind constraints instead of experimenting with incremental change.

## Questions to ask

- **Which constraints are truly hard, and which are habits we can test?**
- **How will we keep today’s services reliable while we modernise?**
- **What signals tell us a temporary workaround has outlived its usefulness?**
- **Where do we need leadership air cover to make pragmatic trade-offs transparent?**

Pragmatism is not surrender; it is disciplined realism. By blending doctrine with situational judgement, organisations can make steady progress without breaking the systems people rely on.
