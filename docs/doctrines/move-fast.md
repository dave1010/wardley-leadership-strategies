Wardley treats "Move fast" as an antidote to organisational inertia. Once a compelling direction is set, the first 100 days determine whether entrenched habits or vested interests derail change. Moving fast means shortening feedback loops, pushing decisions to empowered teams, and demonstrating value before resistance can regroup.

## Why this doctrine matters

- **Speed keeps momentum ahead of inertia.** Visible progress gives reformers credibility and makes it harder for opponents to stall.
- **Rapid feedback exposes risk early.** Quick experiments reveal flawed assumptions while the cost of course correction is low.
- **Cadence builds confidence.** Regular delivery of improvements shows stakeholders that the map-driven plan is working.

## Practices to embed

1. **Set time-boxed missions.** Define 6–12 week objectives tied to specific map movements so teams focus on removing the next constraint.
2. **Form empowered strike teams.** Assemble cross-functional groups with budget authority and clear escalation paths to bypass bureaucracy.
3. **Instrument decision latency.** Track how long approvals, deployments, and procurements take, then remove bottlenecks aggressively.
4. **Narrate progress weekly.** Share tangible user-facing wins and map updates so everyone sees the pace and knows where help is needed.

## Watch for anti-patterns

- Equating speed with recklessness—ignoring governance, safety, or users in the rush to ship.
- Launching monolithic programmes that take years to show value, inviting inertia back in.
- Allowing dependencies or approvals outside the strike team to dictate pace.

## Questions to ask

- **What user-visible improvement will we deliver this quarter, and how does it move the map?**
- **Which decisions are waiting on slow hand-offs, and who can remove that friction?**
- **Where do we need guardrails so speed does not degrade safety or trust?**
- **How quickly do we convert new information into course corrections?**

Moving fast is not a slogan; it is a management discipline. When leaders combine clear maps with empowered teams and short feedback cycles, speed becomes sustainable rather than chaotic.
