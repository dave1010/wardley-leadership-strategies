Wardley stresses that doctrine is meaningless without feedback loops. "Use a systematic mechanism of learning" asks leaders to instrument their environment so that maps improve with every decision. Spending controls, service standards, and outcome telemetry provide the data needed to refine the value chain and spot when assumptions no longer hold.

## Why this doctrine matters

- **Learning keeps maps alive.** Without structured feedback, value chains become static diagrams and teams miss shifts in user demand or component evolution.
- **Evidence trims waste.** Shared metrics reveal duplication, failing experiments, and services that should be retired or outsourced.
- **Measurement disciplines decisions.** When decisions are tied to observable outcomes, debates move from opinion to context-aware trade-offs.

## Practices to embed

1. **Define outcome metrics per user need.** Agree on a small set of measures that reveal whether the map is improving the desired experience.
2. **Instrument decision points.** Capture why a choice was made, what signals supported it, and when the team will review the result.
3. **Run regular learning reviews.** Schedule retrospectives where teams revisit metrics, update maps, and decide whether to amplify or retire experiments.
4. **Feed insights into shared repositories.** Publish post-implementation notes, telemetry dashboards, and revised maps so neighbouring teams can reuse learning.

## Watch for anti-patterns

- Reporting vanity metrics that make leadership feel good but hide user pain.
- Treating audits as compliance exercises instead of opportunities to challenge assumptions.
- Hoarding data in silos, forcing teams to rebuild the same measurements.

## Questions to ask

- **What data tells us whether this user need is being met better than last quarter?**
- **When will we revisit this decision, and what signals could overturn it?**
- **Who is responsible for updating the map when evidence changes?**
- **Which insights should be broadcast to other teams so they do not repeat our mistakes?**
