Being transparent in Wardley Mapping means making decisions, maps, spend, and rationale visible to everyone who depends on them. Wardley highlights transparency as a bias toward open practices: publish the pipeline of change, expose trade-offs, and let peers challenge proposals before inertia sets in. Transparency accelerates learning and keeps strategy rooted in reality.

## Why this doctrine matters

- **Open information invites scrutiny.** When maps, costs, and intent are easy to inspect, duplication and weak arguments surface faster.
- **Shared context builds trust.** Teams can align on priorities when they see the same data and understand the reasoning behind choices.
- **Visibility unlocks ecosystem help.** Partners, suppliers, and users can contribute insights or capabilities when they know what is planned.

## Practices to embed

1. **Maintain a public pipeline of work.** Keep proposals, maps, spending, and status in a shared place that updates automatically.
2. **Default to open artefacts.** Publish documentation, standards, and source code by default, restricting access only when legally required.
3. **Narrate decision rationale.** When approving or rejecting initiatives, record the user need, mapped context, and constraints so future teams can revisit the logic.
4. **Encourage external challenge.** Invite scrutiny from peer departments, communities, or suppliers and respond visibly to feedback.

## Watch for anti-patterns

- Sanitising maps before sharing, hiding the uncomfortable parts of the landscape.
- Treating transparency as a compliance checkbox rather than a tool for learning and accountability.
- Over-sharing raw data without context, leaving people confused about what matters.

## Questions to ask

- **Who can see our current map, and how quickly do updates reach them?**
- **What decisions are still made in private that should be visible to the wider system?**
- **How do we close the loop when someone challenges our plan?**
- **Where does secrecy protect advantage, and where is it just habit?**
