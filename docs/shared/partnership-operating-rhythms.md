### Partnership operating rhythms

Maintaining momentum across organisations requires disciplined routines in {MappingDiscipline}.

- Align on a shared map review cadence so every partner sees landscape shifts at the same time.
- Publish transparent dependency and decision logs to avoid context gaps when teams move at different speeds.
- Rotate facilitators or relationship leads so no single organisation dominates the collaboration.

These routines reinforce trust and keep the partnership grounded in situational awareness rather than internal politics.
