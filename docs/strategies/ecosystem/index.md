# Ecosystem

Ecosystem plays are about using others to do the work. You build platforms, form alliances, or encourage co-creation to drive evolution at scale.

A good ecosystem play aligns your goals with the incentives of others. Done right, you gain leverage, sensing capability, and compounding advantage. Done badly, you lose control and carry the cost.
