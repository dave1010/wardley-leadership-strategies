Also spelt <em>co-option</em>, <em>co-optation</em>, <em>cooption</em>, or <em>cooptation</em>.

In a strategic context, co-opting typically involves absorbing elements of a competitor’s approach—such as standards, practices, or interfaces—to erode their ecosystem advantage. It disrupts data flows, weakens network effects, and attracts participants into an alternative system. 

While effective in redirecting value, co-opting is often seen as parasitic or opportunistic, especially when it undermines the original ecosystem without providing equivalent value.

:::note

This refers to cultural or strategic **absorption**, a type of information co-optation. It does not refer to:

- Elite co-option: incorporating outsiders to manage dissent or preserve dominance (e.g. in politics)
- Procedural co-option: selecting new members via existing structures (e.g. governance or board appointments)
