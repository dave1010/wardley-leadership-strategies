## ü§î **Explanation**

### What are Open Approaches?

Open Approaches are the deliberate act of making a technology, standard, data set, or interface openly available, removing proprietary restrictions to encourage widespread adoption and rapid evolution.

This can include:

- Open source software
- Open standards
- Open data
- Open APIs

The goal is to eliminate friction (cost, licensing, integration) and create a foundation others can build on. This accelerates commoditisation, enables network effects, and often shifts competition to higher layers of value. Open Approaches are frequently used to undercut incumbents, set de facto standards, or build robust ecosystems.

### Why use Open Approaches?

- To drive adoption and become the standard in a market
- To commoditise a layer and move competition elsewhere
- To build a vibrant ecosystem of contributors and partners
- To undercut a rival‚Äôs proprietary advantage
- To accelerate innovation through community involvement

### How to use Open Approaches

- Identify a component that is not your core differentiator but is critical to the ecosystem
- Remove barriers: open the code, data, or interface
- Foster a community and governance model
- Ensure you have a business model that benefits from openness (e.g., services, higher-order offerings)

## üó∫Ô∏è **Real-World Examples**

### Netscape/Mozilla

In 1998, Netscape open-sourced its browser code, creating Mozilla, in a bold move to counter Microsoft‚Äôs dominance. This rallied a global community and accelerated browser innovation, whilst also shifting industry momentum toward open standards. The Mozilla project became a driving force in the W3C and web standards ecosystem, championing interoperability and pushing for a more open, standards-driven web. While Netscape itself did not survive, its open approach fundamentally reshaped the browser market and laid the groundwork for modern web collaboration.

### Google Android

Google released Android as open source, eliminating licensing fees and restrictions for device manufacturers. This openness fueled rapid adoption and made Android the world‚Äôs leading smartphone operating system. While the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) allowed anyone to use and modify the core OS, Google maintained significant influence through proprietary Google Play Services and the app ecosystem. By requiring manufacturers to include these services for full compatibility and access to popular apps, Google retained strategic control and monetised the platform through services and advertising, even as the base OS remained open.

### Open Data Initiatives

Governments and organizations releasing open data sets, such as GPS signals, weather information, or public transport data, have enabled entire industries to emerge and thrive. For example, Transport for London (TfL) provides open APIs for real-time transit data, empowering developers to create journey planners, accessibility tools, and mobility apps. This has resulted in more innovation, ecosystem growth, and unlocked new business opportunities.

### AWS and the Cloud Battle (2006 Wardley Map)

This Wardley Map, created by Chris Adams, illustrates the landscape of AWS in 2006 and highlights how the "battle for cloud" was ultimately lost by competitors who failed to embrace open approaches. Amazon's early lead and proprietary ecosystem, coupled with the lack of open, API-compatible alternatives from competitors, allowed them to dominate the IaaS market. The article argues that a deliberate offensive strategy using open APIs could have fostered a healthier, more competitive ecosystem by undermining Amazon's barriers to entry.

### Cautionary Example: The Fragmentation of Android

While Android's openness was a strategic success for Google, it also created significant challenges. The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) allowed any manufacturer to create their own version of the OS, leading to a fragmented ecosystem. This meant that apps might work on one manufacturer's phone but not another's, creating a poor experience for both users and developers. Google has tried to manage this with compatibility requirements for accessing its Play Store, but the underlying fragmentation remains a persistent issue, demonstrating that openness without strong governance can lead to chaos and a loss of strategic control.

## üéØ **Leadership**

### Core challenge

Balancing the benefits of openness (adoption, ecosystem, innovation) with the risks (loss of control, monetisation challenges, competitor advantage).

### Key leadership skills required

- Strategic ecosystem thinking
- Community building and governance
- Communication and transparency
- Business model innovation
- Risk management

### Ethical considerations

Leaders must ensure openness is genuine (not ‚Äúopen-washing‚Äù), respect contributor rights, and avoid exploiting community labor. Consider the impact on users, partners, and the broader ecosystem.

## üìã **How to Execute**

1. Identify the component to open (not your core differentiator)
2. Choose the right open model (source, standard, data, API)
3. Remove proprietary barriers (licensing, access, documentation)
4. Establish governance and community processes
5. Communicate the value and invite participation
6. Monitor, support, and evolve the open asset
7. Capture value through complementary offerings

## üìà **Measuring Success**

- Growth in adoption and usage
- Number and quality of external contributors
- Ecosystem development (partners, integrations)
- Acceleration of innovation and improvement
- Achievement of strategic objectives (e.g., commoditisation, market share)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfalls and Warning Signs**

### No clear monetization

Opening something without a plan to make money elsewhere (e.g., open sourcing software but not capitalising on services) can hurt revenue.

### Community misalignment

If you don‚Äôt manage the community well, the project may fork or drift away from your strategy, risking loss of control.

### Competitor benefit

Competitors can freely use what you open. If they are better positioned to monetise it, you may inadvertently strengthen them.

### Open-washing

Pretending to be open while retaining hidden restrictions damages trust and undermines the strategy.

## üß† **Strategic Insights**

### Openness as an Engine of Commoditisation

Openness is not altruism: it‚Äôs a tool to accelerate evolution. When you open a component that‚Äôs already heading toward commodity status, you can outpace competitors still clinging to proprietary models. This not only reshapes user expectations but collapses margins across the market, forcing rivals to adapt or die.

In mapping terms, open approaches work best on components moving from product to commodity. You‚Äôre lubricating the movement. You‚Äôre not driving evolution, rather than  responding to it. But if you open too early (while a component is still in genesis or custom), you may invite chaos and fragmentation. Openness is powerful, but only when timed to evolutionary context.

### Ecosystem as a Strategic Weapon

The real benefit of open isn‚Äôt the code or the API, it‚Äôs the ecosystem it enables. By removing friction, you invite others to build, integrate, extend. This is leverage, where your strategic footprint grows without linear investment. You become the gravitational centre.

This creates a positive feedback loop: more users ‚Üí more contributors ‚Üí more integrations ‚Üí more value ‚Üí more users. Over time, your open component becomes the de facto standard, and your position in the ecosystem hardens. The open code is the kernel of a vast, self-reinforcing ecosystem that can be monetised indirectly.

### Counterplay and Strategic Signalling

Openness is not a *safe* play. It‚Äôs a signal to others. It invites counterplay: embrace-and-extend, fork-and-commercialise, regulatory capture via ‚Äúopen standards‚Äù bodies. You have to anticipate the likely responses, and design your openness accordingly. Licences, governance, branding and community structure all become weapons or shields.

For example, if your competitor is slower-moving or dependent on licensing, opening your stack could force them into a corner. But if they‚Äôre faster or better capitalised, they may simply build on what you‚Äôve opened and outcompete you. That‚Äôs why open approaches must be paired with a clear value capture model above the open layer: services, analytics, integrations, brand, or trust.

## ‚ùì **Key Questions to Ask**

- **Value:** What do we gain by making this open?
- **Control:** How will we manage and govern the open asset?
- **Monetisation:** What is our business model above the open layer?
- **Community:** How will we attract and sustain contributors?
- **Risk:** Are we prepared for competitors to benefit from our openness?
