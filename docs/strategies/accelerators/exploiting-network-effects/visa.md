## Visa/Mastercard Network Effects Case Study

Credit card networks like Visa and Mastercard demonstrate network effects in a two-sided market (merchants and cardholders). In the early days, not all merchants accepted cards, and consumers had to carry multiple cards. Visa and Mastercard achieved dominance by rapidly signing up banks, merchants, and consumers to their networks, reaching a scale where everyone uses them because everyone accepts them. As more people carried a Visa/Mastercard, more merchants felt compelled to accept those cards to avoid losing business; as more merchants accepted them, carrying one of those cards became virtually essential for consumers ([Visa & Mastercard Unbeatable Business Model: The Network Effect](https://www.dividendmonk.com/visa-mastercard-unbeatable-business-model/#:~:text=The%20best%20examples%20in%20the,of%20having%20developed%20that%20network)). This mutual growth led to billions of transactions flowing through the duopoly.

A new payment network trying to start today faces enormous hurdles. It would have to convince consumers to carry it *and* convince merchants to install/support it without the guarantee of immediate volume ([Visa & Mastercard Unbeatable Business Model: The Network Effect](https://www.dividendmonk.com/visa-mastercard-unbeatable-business-model/#:~:text=The%20best%20examples%20in%20the,of%20having%20developed%20that%20network)). Visa and Mastercard's network effect is so entrenched that it has become an effective duopoly with high barriers to entry. They serve as an example of how "last man standing" dynamics play out: over decades, competing card networks consolidated or faded, leaving the strongest networks with most of the market share.
