## Facebook (Meta) Network Effects Case Study

Facebook's rise is a textbook case of direct network effects. The more friends and family on the platform, the more compelling it became. As Facebook's user base swelled into the billions, it achieved a near-monopoly on personal social networking ([Harnessing the Power of Network Effects for Product Success - Beyond the Backlog](https://beyondthebacklog.com/2024/02/23/network-effects/#:~:text=We%20have%20already%20touched%20on,leveraging%20powerful%20direct%20networking%20effects)). Users are essentially "locked in" because their social graph (photos, contacts, groups) lives on Facebook: there's no equivalent network where all those same connections exist ([Harnessing the Power of Network Effects for Product Success - Beyond the Backlog](https://beyondthebacklog.com/2024/02/23/network-effects/#:~:text=and%20actively%20engaging,leveraging%20powerful%20direct%20networking%20effects)).

This scale also let Facebook layer on new services (Marketplace, Instagram integration, etc.) to further entrench users. A new social platform faces an uphill battle because it's not enough to build a better app; one would have to convince entire social circles to movem an unlikely prospect given Facebook's incumbency advantage ([Why did Google+ fail? - Business School](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/ib-knowledge/strategy-leadership/why-did-google-fail/#:~:text=Consider%20the%20example%20of%20Google%2B%2C,Economists%20call%20this%20%E2%80%9Cincumbency%20advantage%E2%80%9D)).

Twitter (now X) likewise benefits from network effects (though on a smaller scale), where the presence of celebrities, newsmakers, and one's interests all in one network keeps users coming back ([Harnessing the Power of Network Effects for Product Success - Beyond the Backlog](https://beyondthebacklog.com/2024/02/23/network-effects/#:~:text=opportunities%20to%20command%20higher%20ad,rates)). These social platforms demonstrate how network effects can create winner-take-all outcomes: once Facebook "won" the social networking race, it won it big, capturing the lion's share of users in its category ([What Are Network Effects? | HBS Online](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-are-network-effects#:~:text=For%20a%20real,its%20prominence%20over%20the%20competition)).
