# Accelerators

Accelerators are about pushing components and markets to evolve faster. Youâ€™re trying to speed up commoditisation or adoption so that new higher-order systems can emerge. Think of it as clearing the runway for future plays.

*Open approaches*, *market enablement*, and *network effects* all aim to reduce friction and increase momentum. Use them when you're ready to industrialise or when your strategy depends on shifting others forward.
