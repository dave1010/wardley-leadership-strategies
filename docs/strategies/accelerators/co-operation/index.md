# Co-operation

**Working with others, even competitors, to achieve a goal**.

It sounds straightforward, but as Wardley wryly notes, "sounds easy, actually it's not." This strategy is about forming partnerships, joint ventures, or industry collaborations where mutual benefit can be found.

## ü§î **Explanation**

### What is Co-operation

Co-operation in Wardley's framework refers to deliberate collaboration between entities (including competitors) to achieve mutual benefits that would be difficult or impossible to achieve independently. Unlike general collaboration, strategic co-operation in Wardley Mapping is specifically focused on accelerating component evolution or creating new market spaces through combined capabilities, shared risk, or unified standards.

### Why is Co-operation a valuable leadership strategy?

Co-operation becomes a critical strategy when facing challenges beyond a single entity's capabilities or when the cost of going alone outweighs potential competitive advantage.

It creates value by:

- Pooling complementary capabilities to fill gaps
- Distributing risk across multiple parties
- Accelerating component evolution through shared learning
- Creating standards that expand total market opportunity
- Enabling focus on core competencies while leveraging partners for others

### How?

The origin is basic: two heads (or companies) can be better than one when tackling large challenges (market creation, standards, expensive R&D). The purpose is to achieve something you couldn't alone (or not as efficiently). Key principles: alignment of interests, clear governance, and trust. Co-operation can range from loose (co-marketing agreements, sharing research) to formal (joint venture company, standards consortium). It can **accelerate evolution** by pooling resources and knowledge -- an "accelerator" in that sense. However, culturally it requires stepping out of pure competitive mindset, which is tricky.

## üó∫Ô∏è **Real-World Examples**

-  *Historical:* The **Sony-Ericsson** partnership (early 2000s) -- Sony had consumer electronics expertise, Ericsson had telecom infrastructure and phone tech. They co-operated to create Sony-Ericsson mobile phones, each filling gaps in the other's capabilities. This co-operation allowed them to compete in mobile phones against larger rivals (Nokia, etc.) with a combined strength neither had alone.

![Bluetooth SIG Wardley map](bluetooth-sig-wardley-map.svg)

-  *Historical:* The **Bluetooth SIG (Special Interest Group)** -- an industry co-operation of many companies (Ericsson, Nokia, IBM, Intel, etc.) to develop the Bluetooth standard. Instead of fighting over wireless peripheral connectivity solutions, they co-operated to establish one standard. This expanded the market for everyone's interoperable devices and accelerated Bluetooth's evolution.

-  *Hypothetical:* Two mid-sized pharmaceutical firms co-develop a drug for a rare disease. Each firm had a candidate compound; instead of running two costly parallel trials, they form a co-operative agreement to test a combined therapy and share data. By co-operating, they cut R&D time and cost, and if successful, both share the market (perhaps each selling in different regions). They achieved faster evolution of a treatment than either could alone.

## üö¶ **When to Use / When to Avoid**

### Use when

The **task is too large, risky, or slow** to do alone, and partners have complementary strengths. Also when establishing a new standard or platform where **ecosystem is more valuable than solo control** (e.g., to beat a common enemy or to grow a pie that's currently small). Co-operation is key in early market formation (fighting too early can stall everyone).

### Avoid when

Your goals and potential partners' goals fundamentally clash -- forced co-operation can implode (e.g., if co-development means you later directly compete with the jointly created product, tensions arise). Also avoid if co-operating would give a weaker competitor undue advantage that they can then use against you. If you have the means to win outright, co-operation might unnecessarily share the spoils.

## üéØ **Leadership**

### Core challenge

A leader must **balance control and openness**. Cooperation can accelerate innovation but also risks creating dependencies or eroding unique advantages. Effective leadership in cooperation means structuring agreements that align interests while maintaining strategic flexibility.

### Key leadership skills required

fostering trust, managing alliances, setting governance rules

## üìã **How to Execute**

1. Assess alignment and goals
   - alignment: Incentive structuring: Revenue-sharing models, IP-sharing agreements, performance-based milestones
2. Define governance
   - consortium vs. joint venture vs. strategic partnership
3. Set trust mechanisms
   - build trust early: Pilot projects, transparency mechanisms, pre-agreed dispute resolution
4. Establish exit strategies

### Ethical considerations

## üìà **Measuring Success**

- Speed metrics: Reduction in time-to-market or development cycles compared to solo efforts
- Cost efficiency: Reduced R&D or market-entry costs versus going alone
- Market creation: Growth in total addressable market (especially for standards-based co-operation)
- Knowledge transfer: New capabilities developed within each organization
- Strategic positioning: Improved position on the value chain for core business
- Governance efficiency: Time taken to make joint decisions versus escalations/disputes
- Partner satisfaction: Regular assessment of all parties' perceived value from the arrangement
- Innovation rate: Number of new features, products, or methods developed through the partnership

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfalls and Warning Signs**

### Alignment issues

Co-operation can fail due to misaligned incentives (one party might freeride or diverge later). Clear agreements and exit strategies are crucial.

### Slower decisions

Partnerships mean committees -- things can move slower than a single, decisive entity. This can hamper agility.

### Breaking trust

If one side unilaterally exploits the partnership (e.g., learns from co-operation then goes solo), it can lead to sour relations or even legal battles.

## üß† **Strategic Insights**

### Evolution and Co-operation

Co-operation strategies differ dramatically based on component evolution stage:

- Genesis/Custom: Co-operation focuses on risk-sharing and pooling scarce expertise
- Product/Commodity: Co-operation typically centers on standards creation and market expansion

### Value Chain Positioning

Co-operation allows organizations to:

- Focus on high-value activities while partnering for commoditizing components
- Create "force multipliers" by connecting complementary positions in the value chain
- Defend against disruption by forming collaborative barriers to entry

### Expanding the Pie vs. Fighting for Slices

Wardley's perspective emphasizes that premature competition in emerging markets often stunts overall growth.

Co-operation can:

- Create common platforms that enable innovation at higher levels
- Establish standards that accelerate adoption and market formation
- Allow competitors to focus on differentiation in areas that matter to users while collaborating on underlying infrastructure

### Strategic Leverage Points

Successful co-operation often targets specific *leverage points*:

- Inertia points: Where industry resistance requires collective pressure
- Constraint removal: Where a shared bottleneck limits all players
- Network effects: Where combined user bases create exponentially more value

## ‚ùì **Key Questions to Ask**

- Value alignment: What specific value does each party bring and extract? Are these balanced and sustainable?
- Evolution stage: Where on the evolution curve are the components we're collaborating on? (Genesis, Custom, Product, Commodity)
- Power dynamics: Will this co-operation create dependencies we can't easily escape? Who ultimately controls critical interfaces?
- Competitive exposure: What knowledge or capabilities are we sharing that could later be used against us?
- Decision rights: How will we make decisions when interests inevitably diverge?
- Market impact: Will this co-operation accelerate or inhibit market formation?
- Exit scenarios: Under what conditions should we

## üîÄ **Related Strategies:**

- [**Alliances**](/strategies/ecosystem/alliances) - a formalized group of co-operating entities, essentially the same domain
- [**Co-creation**](/strategies/ecosystem/co-creation) - a form of cooperation with users
- [**Circling and Probing**](/strategies/competitor/circling-and-probing) - is opposite: testing a competitor rather than working with them.
- **Joint Ventures** - the structural embodiment of cooperation.
