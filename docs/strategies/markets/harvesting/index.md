# Harvesting

Harvesting lets you scale innovation without bearing the cost of exploration. The trick is to expose a platform or ecosystem, encourage third-party development, and then watch which offerings gain traction. Once demand is clear, you can acquire, replicate, or integrate.

This must be done delicately: if harvesting looks extractive or predatory, others will avoid your ecosystem. Done right, it creates a reinforcing loop: the more people build on your platform, the more options you get to harvest.

Think of Amazon’s strategy around AWS primitives and how new services emerge from customer usage patterns.

How do you avoid poisoning your ecosystem’s trust post-harvest? Signal management is key.
