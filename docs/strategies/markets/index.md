# Markets

Markets evolve, and different stages require different gameplay.

- In the early uncharted phase (Genesis/Custom), the focus is on exploration and uncertainty—fast iteration, rapid learning, and acceptance of failure.
- As components evolve towards commoditisation, gameplay becomes more about efficiency, optimisation, and scale. Standard plays here include outsourcing, Six Sigma, or price wars.

Mature markets reward those who understand the rules of operational excellence, whereas earlier stages reward those willing to take risks and experiment. Wardley suggests your gameplay must match the component’s evolutionary stage. Misalignment wastes resources and kills competitiveness.
