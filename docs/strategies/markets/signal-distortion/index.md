# Signal distortion

Perception often drives behaviour more than reality. By distorting market signals ()analyst reports, thought leadership, PR) you can shape competitors’ strategies. Make them invest in futures that won’t materialise, or misread your intentions.

This can be framed as **playing the game behind the game**: everyone watches the same analysts and hype curves. If you can manipulate those signals (e.g. through selective announcements or partnerships), you can alter how others act. Think of it as information warfare, weaponising the market’s herd instincts. It’s ethically grey but strategically potent.
