# Standards game

Forcing a market to adopt your standard eliminates competitors’ differentiation and creates high switching costs. This can be achieved by open sourcing your component (removing profit but gaining strategic control), lobbying regulators, or partnering to embed your standard widely.

Once the standard is entrenched, you control the direction, timeline, and ecosystem. Everyone else becomes a commodity provider or adopter. You’re the constraint they must work around.

Strategically, this is brutal but effective: turn their innovation into your baseline.
