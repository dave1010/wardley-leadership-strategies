# Positional

Positional plays are about being in the right place before the market knows it matters.

They’re not reactive, but anticipatory—based on sensing patterns, judging timing, and committing early. You’re placing bets on where the value will be, not where it is.

This does more than create competitive edge, it defines the playing field others must adapt

to. Success here depends on situational awareness, speed, and a willingness to act *before* the path is clear.
