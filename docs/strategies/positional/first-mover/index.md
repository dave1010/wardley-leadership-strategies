Being first to industrialise a component or service can yield strong early advantages:

- brand recognition
- ecosystem gravity
- cost curve leadership

But the benefits only stick if you move fast and scale hard. Many confuse invention with being first: this is about being first to *commoditise* something useful, not just to explore. You’re turning uncertainty into something others can build on. If you don’t entrench quickly, fast followers will eat you alive.
