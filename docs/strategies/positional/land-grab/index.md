# Land Grab

This is a high-conviction move to claim ground early in an emerging space, before others recognise its value.

As well as entering a market, you’re framing it. That might mean building infrastructure, defining the dominant interface, or owning scarce resources. Once you’re in position, anyone else entering must work around you.

Done well, it creates compounding advantage through inertia, integration, and mindshare. It’s expensive, but if the bet is right, decisive.

Have you captured a position, or just walked somewhere that no one else cared about?
