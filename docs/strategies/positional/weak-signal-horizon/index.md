This is the art of sensing where the map is about to shift.

You look for economic patterns, subtle shifts in behaviour, technological readiness, or unserved needs—then orient your strategy before the change is obvious. It’s not prediction, it’s perception.

Those who play well with weak signals tend to arrive early, prepared, and positioned, while competitors are still reacting. It’s foundational to every other positional play.

Do you have mechanisms in place to detect weak signals systematically, or are you still relying on intuition?
