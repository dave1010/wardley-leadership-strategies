# Defensive

These strategies aim to protect what you’ve already captured. You raise barriers, lobby for regulation, or delay action with strategic procrastination.

**Defence isn’t passive**. It’s about using time and policy to your advantage. It’s most useful when your position is strong but vulnerable to change.
