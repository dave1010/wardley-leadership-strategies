### Explanation

Raising barriers to entry, as a defensive strategy in Wardley Mapping, involves strategically increasing the complexity and breadth of requirements that a new entrant must satisfy to successfully compete within a given market 7. This is often achieved by incumbents who leverage their established market presence and broader capabilities to continuously expand the range of user needs that are considered standard within the market. By doing so, they make it significantly more difficult and resource-intensive for new companies to enter with a limited or niche product or service offering. The fundamental aim of this strategy is to make it economically or operationally challenging for potential competitors to meet the elevated set of expectations upon their entry into the market.

### Why is it a valuable strategy?

This strategy can be highly valuable as it can effectively deter potential competitors from even attempting to enter the market due to the significantly increased investment and operational complexity required to meet the heightened expectations 7. For those new entrants who do decide to proceed, raising barriers can substantially slow down their growth, particularly if they initially focus on a narrower set of user needs. Incumbents can leverage their already established and more comprehensive range of capabilities and infrastructure to create a substantial competitive advantage. Furthermore, by providing a more complete solution that addresses a wider spectrum of user needs, incumbents can often enhance customer loyalty and make it less likely for customers to switch to a new entrant with a more limited offering. This can also cultivate a perception of higher overall quality or value associated with the incumbent's more comprehensive approach.

### How is it executed?

Raising barriers to entry through increased expectations involves a multi-faceted approach. One key tactic is to expand product/service offerings continuously, adding new features, functionalities, or complementary services to the existing portfolio to cater to a broader array of user needs 52. Bundling products/services that address multiple user needs into integrated solutions can also make it more challenging for new entrants to compete with a single-product offering (a strategy often categorized under User Perception). Another method is to increase service levels, raising the standard for customer support, after-sales service, or other related aspects of the offering, thereby requiring new entrants to invest more heavily in these areas from the outset. Building strong brand loyalty through consistent investment in brand building and marketing initiatives can create a significant hurdle for new entrants attempting to attract customers, even with a potentially comparable product (another User Perception strategy). Incumbents might also seek to control key resources or distribution channels through exclusive agreements or strategic partnerships, making it difficult for new entrants to access essential elements for effective competition. Increasing marketing and advertising spend to maintain high visibility and strong brand awareness can also outpace the budgets of potential competitors. Finally, if the product or service benefits from network effects, expanding the existing user base can create a powerful advantage that new entrants will struggle to replicate (an Accelerators strategy).

Executing this strategy presents several leadership challenges. Leaders must possess a deep understanding of the full range of evolving user needs and have the foresight to anticipate future expectations within the market 8. Coordinating the development and seamless integration of a broader range of offerings across different product or service lines can be a complex undertaking 11. Maintaining consistent quality and a unified user experience across an expanded portfolio is also a significant challenge. Effectively communicating the value proposition of the comprehensive offering to customers, ensuring they understand the benefits of the broader scope, is crucial. Finally, leaders must be careful to avoid the organization becoming overly complex, bloated, or inefficient by offering too many features or services that may not be highly valued by the majority of users.

Successfully raising barriers requires a specific set of leadership skills. A deep understanding of user needs and prevailing market trends is foundational 8. Strong strategic thinking is essential for anticipating potential competitive threats and proactively planning defensive measures. Excellent execution skills are needed to effectively expand and seamlessly integrate new offerings into the existing portfolio 41. Expertise in marketing and branding is crucial for effectively communicating the value of the comprehensive solution and building strong customer loyalty. Operational efficiency is necessary to manage the increased complexity of a broader range of products or services. Finally, financial acumen is required to effectively manage the investments associated with developing and supporting an expanded portfolio.

### Real world examples

Microsoft's long-standing dominance in the personal computer operating system market provides a strong example of successfully raising barriers to entry. Over time, Microsoft has consistently added a vast array of features and functionalities to Windows, creating a comprehensive operating system that caters to a wide spectrum of user needs. This extensive breadth of offering makes it exceptionally challenging for new operating systems to gain significant market traction. Amazon's strategic expansion beyond its initial focus on e-commerce into numerous diverse areas, including cloud computing (AWS), streaming entertainment (Prime Video), and physical retail (Whole Foods), has created a sprawling ecosystem that presents a formidable challenge for new entrants to replicate. Traditional full-service airlines, by offering a wide array of amenities and services such as in-flight meals, entertainment options, and loyalty programs, often raise the expectations for a comprehensive travel experience, making it more difficult for ultra-low-cost carriers with a more basic offering to appeal to all segments of the market.

Conversely, the struggles of traditional department stores against the rise of specialized and niche retailers could be considered a failed attempt at maintaining barriers through breadth. While department stores aimed to be a one-stop shop for a wide variety of needs, they have often been outcompeted by retailers offering deeper expertise and more focused selections within specific categories. The attempt to cater to every possible need may have backfired against more targeted approaches. Similarly, early smartphone manufacturers who focused on specific features or primarily targeted business users often failed to compete with the later dominance of Apple and Android. Apple, with its tightly integrated ecosystem and user-friendly interface, and Android, with its open platform and vast app ecosystem, raised the expectations for a comprehensive mobile experience that many early players were unable to meet.

### When to use the strategy

Raising barriers to entry by increasing market expectations is a particularly effective strategy for companies that already possess a strong market position and a broad range of existing capabilities. It is most appropriate when there is a clear and evolving understanding of the needs of the target market and when potential competitors are likely to attempt entry with a more focused or niche offering. Companies with the necessary scale and resources to effectively expand their offerings and maintain quality across a wider portfolio are well-suited to employ this tactic. Furthermore, if a strong sense of brand loyalty can be cultivated around a comprehensive solution that addresses a multitude of user needs, this strategy can be particularly potent.

### When to avoid the strategy

This strategy should be avoided when the company lacks the necessary resources or capabilities to effectively expand its offerings without compromising the quality of its core products or services. In highly fragmented markets where niche players can thrive by deeply focusing on very specific user needs, attempting to broaden the appeal too much might dilute the value proposition and open the door for specialized competitors. If the effort to meet an ever-increasing number of user needs leads to a diluted or less focused value proposition, it might be counterproductive. In rapidly evolving technological landscapes, where future user needs are difficult to predict, investing heavily in expanding offerings in potentially wrong directions can be risky. Finally, if the overall cost of significantly expanding the product or service portfolio outweighs the anticipated benefits of deterring potential competitors, it might not be a financially sound strategy.

### Leadership challenges

Leaders face several key challenges when attempting to raise barriers to entry by increasing market expectations. Maintaining a clear and consistent strategic focus while simultaneously expanding the range of offerings requires careful navigation. Ensuring that new offerings are seamlessly integrated with existing ones and provide a cohesive and positive user experience across the entire portfolio is a significant hurdle. Managing the inherent complexity that comes with a broader product or service portfolio demands strong organizational capabilities. Leaders must also be vigilant in avoiding the trap of "feature creep," where unnecessary or low-value features are added, potentially diluting the core value proposition. Making difficult decisions about which specific user needs to prioritize and address within the expanded offerings is crucial for maintaining focus and efficiency.

### Leadership skills required

Successfully executing a strategy of raising barriers to entry demands a diverse set of leadership skills. Strong strategic thinking coupled with a deep understanding of the market and competitive landscape is essential. Leaders must also possess excellent execution and project management skills to oversee the development and integration of new offerings. A strong sense of customer-centricity and a thorough understanding of evolving user needs are paramount. Expertise in innovation and product development is crucial for identifying and creating valuable new features and services. Effective organizational design and coordination skills are necessary to manage the increased complexity of a broader portfolio. Finally, financial acumen is required to make sound investment decisions regarding the expansion of offerings.

### Ethical considerations

Raising barriers to entry can lead to ethical concerns. There is the potential for creating a "walled garden" ecosystem that effectively locks in customers and stifles overall competition within the market. This strategy also carries the risk of unfairly excluding smaller or less resourced competitors who may lack the capacity to meet the expanded set of requirements. Furthermore, the attempt to offer a wider range of solutions could lead to the expanded offerings becoming bloated, less focused, or even of lower quality compared to more specialized alternatives. Leaders must also consider the fairness and transparency in how they communicate the value of their comprehensive offering compared to simpler, more focused alternatives available in the market.

### Measuring success

The success of a strategy aimed at raising barriers to entry can be measured by several key indicators. One primary measure is the observable deterrence of new entrants into the market. Another is the noticeable slowing down of growth among existing competitors. An increase in customer loyalty and retention rates can also indicate that the more comprehensive offering is resonating with customers and making them less likely to switch. A higher overall market share compared to competitors suggests that the strategy is effectively protecting and potentially growing the incumbent's position. Positive customer perception of the breadth and quality of the comprehensive offering is another important indicator. Finally, the financial performance of the expanded product or service portfolio, including its contribution to overall revenue and profitability, is a critical measure of success.

### Common pitfalls and warning signs

Expanding offerings without a clear and thorough understanding of actual user needs can lead to a significant pitfall, resulting in low adoption rates of the newly added features or services 46. Overextending the company's resources in an attempt to offer too much can dilute the quality of the core offerings, potentially alienating existing customers. Creating an overly complex and confusing product or service portfolio can overwhelm customers and make it difficult for them to understand the value proposition. A failure to effectively communicate the benefits of the comprehensive offering compared to simpler alternatives can also undermine the strategy. The increased complexity associated with a broader portfolio can sometimes lead to the company becoming slow, bureaucratic, and less agile. Several warning signs might indicate that the strategy is not working as intended, including low adoption rates of new features, declining customer satisfaction with the core offerings, increased operational costs and complexity, and a growing perception of the company as unfocused or bloated 48.

### Strategic insights

Raising barriers to entry by strategically increasing the expectations within a market is a proactive defensive strategy that directly shapes the competitive landscape. It demands a deep and nuanced understanding of evolving user needs and the ability to execute effectively across a broader and more complex range of offerings. If implemented successfully, this strategy can create a significant and sustainable competitive advantage, making it considerably more challenging for new players to enter and thrive. However, it is crucial to balance the desire to deter competitors with the ongoing need to maintain strategic focus, operational efficiency, and a clear and compelling value proposition for the target market.

### Key questions to ask

Before implementing a strategy to raise barriers to entry, several key questions should be addressed. What are the currently evolving needs of our target market, and what unmet needs might emerge in the future? What additional products or services could we strategically offer to meet a broader range of these user needs? How can we effectively bundle our existing and potential offerings to create more comprehensive and compelling solutions for our customers? What level of investment and what specific resources will be required to expand our capabilities and ensure consistent quality across a wider product or service portfolio? What is the most effective way to communicate the value proposition of our comprehensive offering to our customers, ensuring they understand the benefits of the expanded scope? What are the potential risks and drawbacks of expanding our offerings too broadly, such as diluting our core focus or overextending our resources? Finally, how will we effectively measure the success of our efforts to raise barriers to entry and continuously adapt our strategy based on market feedback and competitive responses?

### Related strategies

Raising barriers to entry can often involve leveraging different aspects of an Ecosystem, such as integrating various components or services to create a more comprehensive and harder-to-replicate offering. Strong Brand and marketing efforts (User Perception) are crucial for effectively communicating the value of a more comprehensive solution and building the customer loyalty that acts as a significant barrier to entry. Bundling (User Perception) is a specific and often effective tactic used to raise barriers by offering a package of products or services that address multiple user needs, making it harder for single-product entrants to compete. While raising barriers aims to deter real competitors, artificial competition (User Perception) can create the illusion of choice and competition without actually making it easier for new entrants to enter the market. Defensive regulation, while also a barrier to entry, specifically relies on government intervention to increase the requirements for operating in a market, whereas raising barriers is a broader strategy that encompasses various market-based tactics.
