# Raising Barriers to Entry

**A defensive strategy of increasing the complexity and scope of a product or service to make it more difficult for new competitors to enter the market.**

> *"Increasing expectations within a market for a range of user needs to be met in order to prevent others entering the market."*
>
> - Simon Wardley

## ü§î **Explanation**

### What is Raising Barriers to Entry?

Raising Barriers to Entry is a defensive strategy where an incumbent company makes it harder for new rivals to enter its market. Instead of competing on a single product or feature, the incumbent deliberately expands its offering, bundling multiple features and services together. This raises the table stakes, forcing any potential new entrant to develop a much more complex and comprehensive product just to be considered a viable alternative. The goal is to make the cost and effort of entry so high that it deters potential competitors altogether.

### Why use this strategy?

This is a powerful defensive move for established players. The key benefits are:

*   **Deterring Competition:** The high cost and complexity of entry can scare off potential new entrants.
*   **Slowing Down New Entrants:** Even if a competitor does enter, they will likely have a narrower offering, making it difficult for them to compete with your more comprehensive solution.
*   **Increasing Customer Stickiness:** Customers who are embedded in a broad ecosystem of products and services are less likely to switch to a new provider with a more limited offering.
*   **Creating a Perception of Value:** A comprehensive, bundled solution can be perceived as offering more value and quality than a collection of standalone products.

## üó∫Ô∏è **Real-World Examples**

### Microsoft Office Suite

In the 1990s, the market for productivity software was fragmented, with separate best-of-breed applications for word processing (WordPerfect), spreadsheets (Lotus 1-2-3), and presentations (Harvard Graphics). Microsoft bundled its own, arguably inferior, applications into the Microsoft Office suite and sold it at a very attractive price. This raised the barrier to entry enormously. A new competitor could no longer just build a better word processor; they had to build a full suite of applications that were integrated with each other. This strategy was instrumental in Microsoft's dominance of the office productivity market.

### Atlassian's Product Ecosystem

Atlassian has built a powerful barrier to entry in the software development tooling market. They offer a tightly integrated suite of products, including Jira (project management), Confluence (documentation), Bitbucket (code hosting), and many others. A new startup might be able to build a better project management tool than Jira, but it is very difficult to compete with the entire integrated Atlassian ecosystem, which has become the standard for many development teams.

## üö¶ **When to Use / When to Avoid**

<Assessment strategyName="Raising Barriers to Entry">
  <MapSignals>
    <li>Your map shows that your product is part of a larger value chain with many adjacent components that could be bundled.</li>
    <li>New entrants are attempting to enter the market by focusing on a single, niche component of your offering.</li>
    <li>Customers are showing a preference for integrated solutions over a collection of point solutions.</li>
    <li>You have the capability to build or acquire and integrate these adjacent components.</li>
  </MapSignals>
  <Readiness>
    <li>We have a strong market position and the resources to invest in expanding our product portfolio.</li>
    <li>Our organization is skilled at integrating different products and technologies into a cohesive user experience.</li>
    <li>We have a strong brand that can be leveraged to promote the bundled solution.</li>
    <li>Our leadership is willing to increase complexity to build a long-term defensive moat.</li>
  </Readiness>
</Assessment>

### Use when:

*   You are an incumbent with a strong market position.
*   You have the resources to build or acquire and integrate a suite of products.
*   The market is maturing, and customers are beginning to value convenience and integration over best-of-breed point solutions.

### Avoid when:

*   You are a new entrant with limited resources. You cannot win by playing the incumbent's game.
*   Customers have a strong preference for best-of-breed solutions and are willing to do the integration work themselves.
*   The effort to build and maintain a complex, bundled solution would distract you from your core mission.

## üéØ **Leadership**

### Core challenge

The core leadership challenge is managing the increased complexity that this strategy entails. Building and maintaining a large, integrated suite of products is difficult and expensive. Leaders must ensure that the organization does not become slow, bloated, and bureaucratic as a result. There is a constant tension between adding more to the bundle to raise the barrier, and keeping the product focused and easy to use.

### Key leadership skills required

*   **Portfolio Management:** The ability to manage a complex portfolio of products and make strategic decisions about what to build, buy, or partner.
*   **Integration:** The skill to ensure that the different parts of the bundle work together seamlessly.
*   **Strategic Focus:** The discipline to avoid "feature creep" and only add components to the bundle that genuinely increase the barrier to entry.

### Ethical considerations

This strategy can be seen as anti-competitive, as it is explicitly designed to make it harder for new companies to enter the market. This can lead to less choice and higher prices for consumers in the long run. Bundling products together can also be seen as a form of tying, which can raise antitrust concerns. Leaders must be careful not to cross the line from fair competition to illegal, anti-competitive behavior.

## üìã **How to Execute**

1.  **Identify Adjacent Needs:** Analyze your customers' workflow and identify the adjacent needs that are not being met by your core product.
2.  **Build, Buy, or Partner:** Decide whether to build the additional functionality yourself, acquire a company that already has it, or partner with another company.
3.  **Bundle and Integrate:** Combine the different components into a single, integrated suite. The integration is key ‚Äì the bundle should be more valuable than the sum of its parts.
4.  **Price the Bundle Attractively:** Price the bundle in a way that makes it a compelling choice compared to buying a collection of separate point solutions.
5.  **Market the Solution:** Clearly communicate the value proposition of the integrated solution to the market.

## üìà **Measuring Success**

*   **Lack of New Entrants:** Is the strategy successfully deterring new companies from entering your market?
*   **Market Share:** Are you maintaining or growing your market share?
*   **Adoption of the Bundle:** Are customers choosing to buy the full suite rather than individual components?
*   **Customer Retention:** Is the bundled solution increasing customer stickiness and reducing churn?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfalls and Warning Signs**

### Bloatware
Adding too many features and components can lead to a bloated, confusing product that is difficult to use.

### Poor Integration
If the different parts of the bundle don't work well together, the strategy will backfire. The integration must be seamless.

### Neglecting the Core
Focusing on building the bundle can lead to neglecting the quality of the core product, which can open the door for a competitor with a superior point solution.

### Customer Resistance
Some customers may not want the full bundle and may resent being forced to buy features they don't need.

## üß† **Strategic Insights**

### The Power of the Suite
This strategy recognizes that in many markets, the company that wins is not the one with the best individual product, but the one with the best integrated suite of products. The whole is often greater than the sum of its parts.

### Competition on a New Level
Raising the barriers to entry shifts the basis of competition. It's no longer about a single feature or product, but about the entire ecosystem. This is a game that incumbents are much more likely to win.

## ‚ùì **Key Questions to Ask**

*   **The Customer's Workflow:** What are all the steps in our customer's workflow, and which of them can we incorporate into our product?
*   **The Integration Value:** How can we make the integrated suite more valuable than the separate components?
*   **The Competitive Response:** How are our competitors likely to react to this move? Can they build their own bundle?
*   **The Complexity Cost:** Are we prepared to manage the increased complexity of a larger product portfolio?
