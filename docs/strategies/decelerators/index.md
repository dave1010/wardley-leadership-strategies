# Decelerators

Decelerators (or **De-accelerators**) are used to slow evolution: buying time or protecting revenue.

These strategies impose constraints or drag on change to maintain advantage or prepare the ground on your terms. These are often defensive but can be offensive when used to trap others. Use them carefully. If overused, they can create fragility or provoke regulatory pushback.
