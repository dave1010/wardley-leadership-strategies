**Definition & Summary:** Finding an **existing bottleneck or limitation** in a competitor or market and **reinforcing it to hinder others** . Essentially, you turn someone else's constraint into a weapon by amplifying its effects (for example, driving demand beyond their supply capacity).

**Detailed Explanation:** Many businesses have constraints -- a limited resource, a single supplier, a regulatory cap, etc. Exploiting a constraint means you deliberately push conditions such that the constraint binds harder. Origin in tactics like price wars: if a rival can only produce so much, you lower price to increase demand beyond their capacity, making them fail to deliver . The purpose is to fragment or weaken a competitor by overstretching them. Key principles: identify a choke point (maybe raw materials, manufacturing rate, distribution channel) and act in a way that stress-tests that point. Often it's **through market manipulation** (like flooding market or aggressive promotion) so the competitor's constraint causes them to lose sales or incur extra cost.

**Real-World Examples:**

-  *Historical:* **Standard Oil** (late 1800s) famously would flood local markets with cheap oil to exceed what smaller refiners could supply (a price war tactic). Smaller competitors couldn't meet the surge in demand at those low prices -- their capacity (and capital) was constrained -- so they would go bankrupt, letting Standard Oil later raise prices. Here Rockefeller exploited the competitors' supply constraint by creating a demand they couldn't fulfill at that price.

-  *Historical:* In tech manufacturing, there have been cases like **NVIDIA vs. smaller GPU makers** -- if NVIDIA secures a vast majority of the available cutting-edge memory chips (buying up supply), a constraint is created for others. Then launching multiple products at once (increasing demand for those chips overall) means competitors can't get enough memory chips for their devices. NVIDIA exploited a supply constraint (access to latest memory) and manipulated demand by swiftly expanding its product lineup, choking others out for that generation.

-  *Hypothetical:* Two cloud service providers operate in a region with limited data center electricity capacity (a constraint). Provider A quickly signs deals to use up most of the power allotment for new data centers (even if slightly beyond immediate need). Provider B, when trying to expand, hits the power supply constraint and can't grow capacity for customers. Provider A exploited the infrastructure constraint by **grabbing resources early**, leaving Provider B stuck unable to scale, thus slowing B's growth while A serves the increased demand.

**When to Use / When to Avoid:**

-  **Use when:** A competitor has a clear **weak link in their value chain** (production limit, key dependency) and you have the means to strain it. Also use if the market is price-sensitive and you have deeper pockets -- a temporary price war can exploit a rival's limited financial or supply endurance . It's effective if you can survive the stress better than they can.

-  **Avoid when:** You are equally or more constrained -- then you might trigger mutually assured destruction (e.g., both can't meet demand and customers end up frustrated with everyone). Also avoid if it could severely damage the market (driving prices too low for too long might permanently shrink profits for all). If constraints are external (like a supplier that might favor the other under pressure), it could backfire.

**Common Pitfalls:**

-  **Misjudging capacity:** If the competitor's constraint was not as tight as you thought (maybe they had hidden reserve capacity or can mitigate quickly), you could end up in a ruinous fight with no gain.

-  **Collateral damage:** Overloading a supply chain or market can upset customers or partners (e.g., if you flood the market with product, your own margins suffer and customers might question quality).

-  **Tit-for-tat escalation:** The competitor, once aware, might retaliate differently (they could exploit *your* constraints elsewhere or engage regulators if they view your tactic as predatory).

**Related Strategies:** **Price War (Last Man Standing)** -- price manipulation is a common way to exploit capacity constraints , **Creating Constraints** (the next strategy, where you add a new constraint -- here you exploit an existing one), **Fragmentation Play** (exploiting constraints can fragment a competitor's customer base if they can't serve them).
