**Definition & Summary:** Internally **reorganizing and repurposing components of a legacy system** to salvage value or reduce toxicity . Refactoring means breaking the old asset into parts, reassigning useful parts to new roles, and eliminating the rest -- akin to code refactoring in software, but applied to business assets.

**Detailed Explanation:** Rather than outright disposal or sale, refactoring keeps the asset in-house but **transforms it**. Origin is from programming (improving internal structure without changing external behavior). In business, it might mean dividing a legacy operation into components: some can merge into other departments, some tasks automated or given new purpose, and only the truly unusable parts are shed. Purpose: *reduce losses and integrate leftover value* into the organization in a leaner way . Key principles: identify components (people, tech, processes) that can be useful elsewhere. For example, maybe the product is dead but the underlying database could support another service, or the team can be moved to a different project with slight retraining. By refactoring, you gradually wind down the old structure while not wasting everything.

**Real-World Examples:**

-  *Software/Tech:* Many companies "refactor" their legacy IT -- e.g., taking an old mainframe application and breaking it into microservices or migrating functions to modern systems one piece at a time (some parts might be turned into APIs for new apps). In doing so, they preserve critical logic or data (value) but eliminate the monolithic, hard-to-maintain structure. IBM's example with moving combustion engine production offshore (per forum) was partly a physical refactoring -- shifting location and focusing that unit solely on being a cost-efficient piece until shut down .

-  *Industrial:* A car manufacturer phasing out combustion engines might refactor its production: move older engine production lines to a lower-cost factory (like VW moving them to Poland ) and repurpose some facilities to build electric components. They aren't just scrapping everything -- they reassign factories or workers to new tasks where possible (e.g., train engine designers to work on electric drive trains). Ultimately, when combustion ends, they have minimized domestic impact and squeezed remaining value from those engines in a cheaper setting -- a mix of sweat (in cheaper plant) and integration (transition workforce to new tech).

-  *Hypothetical:* A publishing company has a huge staff for print magazine layout -- a diminishing need. Instead of mass layoffs, it refactors: it retrains a chunk of them in digital content layout and transfers them to the web team (useful skill reuse), it automates some layout tasks with software, and for the purely excess roles, it offers either internal transfers (some designers might move to marketing department) or packages out. The physical space freed by a smaller print team is converted into a multimedia studio for new digital content. This way, the company gradually morphs the legacy print operation into a leaner, partly repurposed unit that complements the digital side, rather than a sudden chop.

**When to Use / When to Avoid:**

-  **Use when:** The legacy asset has **subcomponents of value** that you can clearly redeploy. Often applicable if the asset's decline is not immediate overnight -- you have time to plan and execute a thoughtful re-org. It's good if you value retaining employees or knowledge and want to redeploy them (cultural continuity) rather than sever ties completely. Refactoring is best when the legacy's end state is foreseeable and you can systematically carve it up over time.

-  **Avoid when:** The toxic asset is hemorrhaging so badly that incremental changes won't stop the bleeding -- sometimes you need a quick cut (disposal) rather than gentle refactor. Also avoid if the effort to refactor is too high or distracts too much from core (sometimes dismantling internally can consume a lot of management attention -- if that's the case, might be better to do sweat & dump or pig in poke). If no part of the old is really salvageable or compatible with new directions, refactoring may just delay the inevitable.

**Common Pitfalls:**

-  **Scope creep:** Refactoring can turn into a never-ending project if not clearly bounded ("while we're at it, let's also overhaul X..."). Need discipline to ensure it serves the purpose of winding down legacy gracefully, not becoming an excuse to tinker indefinitely.

-  **Parallel costs:** During refactoring, you often run old and new in parallel (to keep things running while transitioning parts). This can be costly. If not managed, you might double spend for a while and upper management could lose patience.

-  **Internal confusion:** Employees may be unsure of their future roles during the reassignments. Clear communication is needed to avoid morale issues among those being repurposed.

**Related Strategies:** **Disposal of Liability** (refactoring is an approach to disposal by reuse), **Optimizing Flow** (Wardley's doctrine concept -- refactoring legacy improves flow by removing waste), and it complements **Sweat & Dump** as an alternative -- instead of third-party, you internally transform.

**Further Reading & References:**

-  Wardley Maps Forum -- *Refactoring example* . Mentions VW focusing on building know-how in electric while moving combustion to be eventually shut -- refactoring their manufacturing footprint to handle transition.

-  Agile/DevOps analogies -- Many tech companies apply refactoring to processes: e.g., breaking a legacy business process into agile teams. Business literature on **business process re-engineering** touches similar ideas (though BPR often aimed at improvement, here aim is also removal).

-  *"Dual Transformation" (Anthony, Johnson)* -- a strategy book that talks about running a legacy business (Transformation B) while building new (Transformation A), and how to transfer capabilities from B to A. It's essentially how to refactor an organization during disruption, moving old capabilities to new growth -- similar to refactoring concept described here.
