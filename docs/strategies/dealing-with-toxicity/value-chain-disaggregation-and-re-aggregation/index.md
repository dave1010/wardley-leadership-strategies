**Value Chain Disaggregation involves strategically breaking down existing, often integrated, processes, services, and functions within a value chain into their more granular component parts. Re-aggregation is the subsequent, deliberate recombination or re-engineering of these newly disaggregated parts to better meet evolving user needs, enable new business models, or address emerging competitive landscapes.**

:::note
This strategy isn't explicitly mentioned in Wardley's [On 61 different forms of gameplay](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/05/on-61-different-forms-of-gameplay.html).
:::

## 🤔 **Explanation**

### What is Value Chain Disaggregation and Re-aggregation?

This gameplay is employed to unlock distinct operating and business models, address new market opportunities that were previously obscured by integrated structures, enhance organizational agility, and strategically respond to shifts in where value is captured within an industry. It allows organizations to redefine their role, participate in new segments of the value chain, or create entirely novel value propositions.

The core idea is to move from monolithic structures to a more modular and flexible approach. By breaking down large components, organizations can:

- Optimize individual parts independently.
- Source components more effectively (e.g., build vs. buy vs. partner).
- Respond faster to market changes.
- Create new combinations of services.

### Strategic Intent & Rationale

The strategic intent is to gain a competitive advantage by fundamentally altering how value is created and delivered. This can involve:

- **Unlocking New Business Models:** Disaggregation can reveal new ways to serve customers or enter new markets.
- **Increasing Agility:** Smaller, independent components can be changed or updated more quickly than large, integrated systems.
- **Focusing on Core Competencies:** Organizations can focus on parts of the value chain where they have a distinct advantage and outsource or partner for others.
- **Responding to Ecosystem Shifts:** As industries evolve, disaggregation allows companies to adapt to new roles and opportunities.

### Manifestation on a Wardley Map

This is a direct and profound manipulation of how components are structured and interlinked on the Wardley Map.

- An existing, monolithic component might be broken down into multiple, more granular sub-components. For example, a single 'Telco Network' component could disaggregate into 'Network Hardware' (potentially moving further right towards 'Commoditized' or 'Utility') and 'Network Software Functions' (which might be 'Custom' or even 'Genesis' if newly developed).
- New relationships are then formed between these newly defined or re-combined components.
- Disaggregation facilitates the creation of entirely new value chains or the fundamental re-definition of existing ones. This can lead to the identification and satisfaction of previously unmet user needs, or the fulfillment of existing needs through innovative combinations of capabilities.
- The map gains new nodes and new dependency chains.
- By disaggregating their value chains, organizations can expose themselves to new forms of competition (e.g., from specialized cloud providers, agile network providers, or vertical-specific actors). Conversely, re-aggregation allows for strategic positioning within this new landscape, enabling the organization to capture value in areas where it is shifting (e.g., services built on top of the network).

The repeated emphasis on "breaking up processes, services and functions... into their component parts" and "separating out network functions (from their underlying hardware but also into their component parts)" signifies a strategic move towards modularization of the value chain. This goes beyond simple reorganization; it describes a deliberate deconstruction of large, often monolithic, components into smaller, more granular, and independent modules, thereby affording an organization significant strategic flexibility and agility. On a Wardley Map, this translates to taking a single, potentially complex component (e.g., "Traditional Telco Network") and deliberately transforming it into multiple, distinct, and more granular components (e.g., "Network Hardware Infrastructure," "Core Network Software Function A," "Edge Computing Platform," etc.). This allows each new, smaller component to be managed, evolved, or even sourced independently, potentially at different speeds or with different operating models. This action is about deliberately increasing the granularity of the map to identify new points of leverage, innovation, or competition. It is a strategic act to accelerate the evolution of specific sub-components by isolating them from the inertia or dependencies of the larger, integrated system, thereby enabling greater "efficiency" and "innovation" across the entire value chain. This is a powerful action for industries facing intense commoditization pressures or requiring rapid adaptation to new technological paradigms.

### Distinction from Doctrines and Climate

Value Chain Disaggregation and Re-aggregation is a highly disruptive, complex, and resource-intensive strategic undertaking, not a routine best practice. It demands a deep understanding of industry trends, technological capabilities, and evolving competitive dynamics. It represents a major re-architecture of the business model, not a continuous improvement effort. While external factors such as technological advancements, market saturation, or shifts in customer expectations (climate patterns) might create the conditions or necessity for disaggregation, the decision and execution to break apart and re-form a value chain is a deliberate, internal strategic action taken by the organization. It is a proactive response to climate, not the climate itself.

### Comparison with Refactoring

While both strategies involve breaking down existing structures, their intent, scale, and outcomes are different:

| Feature | Refactoring | Value Chain Disaggregation / Re-aggregation |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Primary Intent** | Salvage value, reduce internal toxicity, gradual clean-up of a legacy | Strategic transformation to unlock new models, roles, and market opportunities |
| **Scale of Change** | Incremental, internal, reversible | Radical, structural, industry-facing |
| **Scope** | Internal systems, teams, tech stacks | Entire value chains, sometimes across industries |
| **Analogy** | Code refactor | System re-architecture |
| **Typical Driver** | Internal pain or decay | External pressure or opportunity |
| **Output** | Leaner, more focused legacy system or components reused internally | New business models, external repositioning, new ecosystems |
| **Map Impact** | Some re-linking, movement of components, internal value realisation | Major map redraw: new components, new dependencies, exposure to new actors |

## 🗺️ **Real-World Examples**

### Telco Disaggregation

A prime example is Telco Disaggregation, which involves the breaking up of traditional telecoms technology, organizational structures, and value chains into their component parts, such as separating network functions from underlying hardware, leading to new organizational models and business approaches. The emergence of new players, where traditional telcos face increased competition from cloud players, specialist network providers, and vertical-specific actors, is a direct consequence of value chain disaggregation. For instance, a traditional telco might separate its network infrastructure (physical cables, towers) from its service layer (mobile plans, data services) and even further into software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) components. This allows them to partner with cloud providers for some functions, specialize in others, or offer their infrastructure to third-party service providers.

### Financial Services (FinTech)

The rise of FinTech is largely driven by the disaggregation of traditional banking services. Previously, a bank offered everything from current accounts and loans to investments and payments. Now, specialized FinTech companies focus on individual components:

- **Payments:** Stripe, PayPal
- **Lending:** SoFi, LendingClub
- **Wealth Management:** Robinhood, Betterment
Traditional banks are forced to either compete with these specialized players, partner with them, or re-aggregate services in new ways (e.g., by offering a platform that integrates various FinTech solutions).

### Media and Entertainment

The traditional media value chain (content creation, aggregation, distribution) has been significantly disaggregated.

- **Content Creation:** Independent creators, production studios.
- **Aggregation:** Streaming platforms (Netflix, Disney+), social media.
- **Distribution:** Internet Service Providers, device manufacturers.
Netflix, for example, initially focused on distribution (DVDs by mail), then moved into aggregation (streaming licenses), and finally into content creation (original programming). This demonstrates both disaggregation (breaking the hold of traditional studios and broadcasters) and re-aggregation (creating a new, vertically integrated model for specific content).

## 🎯 **Leadership**

### Core Challenge

The core challenge is **managing the immense complexity and uncertainty** inherent in redesigning an entire value chain. This includes overcoming internal resistance to dismantling established structures, fostering new collaborative relationships (potentially with former competitors), and navigating the transition period where old and new models coexist. It requires a bold vision and the ability to steer the organization through a period of profound change.

### Key leadership skills required

- **Visionary Thinking:** Ability to see new possibilities and articulate a compelling future state.
- **Strategic Partnership Development:** Skill in forging and managing alliances and collaborations.
- **Change Leadership:** Capacity to inspire and guide the organization through radical transformation.
- **Systems Thinking:** Understanding how different parts of the value chain interact and how changes in one area will impact others.
- **Risk Management:** Ability to identify and mitigate the significant risks associated with value chain restructuring.
- **Decisiveness:** Making tough choices about what to keep, what to discard, and how to reconfigure.

### Ethical Considerations

- **Impact on Workforce:** Disaggregation can lead to job displacement or significant changes in roles. Leaders must manage this ethically, considering retraining, redeployment, and fair severance.
- **Partner Relationships:** New or altered relationships with suppliers, distributors, and other partners must be handled transparently and fairly.
- **Customer Impact:** Ensure that changes do not negatively affect customer experience or lock them into unfavorable situations.
- **Market Power:** Re-aggregation strategies should not lead to anti-competitive practices or abuse of market dominance.

## 📋 **How to Execute**

1. **Map the Existing Value Chain:** Thoroughly understand and map your current value chain, identifying all key components, activities, and dependencies.
2. **Identify Disaggregation Points:** Analyze the map for components that could be separated to improve efficiency, foster innovation, or enable new business models. Look for bottlenecks, areas of high cost, or activities that are not core competencies.
3. **Analyze External Drivers:** Understand market trends, technological advancements, and competitor actions that might necessitate or enable disaggregation.
4. **Envision Future Value Chains:** Brainstorm and map potential re-aggregated value chains. How could disaggregated components be recombined (internally or with partners) to create new value?
5. **Assess Feasibility and Risk:** Evaluate the strategic, operational, financial, and technical feasibility of potential new value chain configurations. Identify key risks and develop mitigation plans.
6. **Develop a Phased Transition Plan:** Outline the steps to move from the current state to the desired future state. This may involve pilot projects, staged rollouts, and parallel operations.
7. **Build Necessary Capabilities:** Invest in the skills, technologies, and partnerships required for the new value chain structure.
8. **Execute and Iterate:** Implement the plan, continuously monitoring progress and making adjustments as needed. This is not a one-time event but an ongoing process of adaptation.

## 📈 **Measuring Success**

- **New Revenue Streams:** Generation of revenue from new business models or market segments enabled by disaggregation/re-aggregation.
- **Increased Agility:** Faster time-to-market for new products/services; quicker response to competitive threats.
- **Cost Optimization:** Reduced costs in specific parts of the value chain through specialization or outsourcing.
- **Ecosystem Growth:** Successful development of new partnerships and collaborations.
- **Improved Customer Outcomes:** Enhanced customer satisfaction due to new or improved value propositions.
- **Market Share Growth:** Gaining ground in existing or new markets.

## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls and Warning Signs**

- **Over-Fragmentation:** Disaggregating too much can lead to a loss of integration benefits and increased coordination costs.
- **Failure to Re-aggregate Effectively:** Simply breaking things apart is not enough; value is created in the intelligent recombination of components.
- **Internal Resistance:** Established business units may resist changes that threaten their current roles or resources.
- **Partner Misalignment:** Difficulty in aligning goals and operations with new partners in a re-aggregated value chain.
- **Loss of Key Capabilities:** Inadvertently losing critical skills or knowledge during the disaggregation process.
- **Underestimating Complexity:** The transformation is often more complex and takes longer than anticipated.

## 🧠 **Strategic Insights**

### Modularity as a Strategic Weapon

The core of this strategy is creating modularity. This allows different parts of the value chain to evolve at different speeds, be sourced from different providers, and be combined in flexible ways. This is a powerful way to manage complexity and increase adaptability in fast-changing environments.

### Shifting Locus of Value Capture

Disaggregation often reveals that value is shifting within an industry. For example, value might move from integrated hardware/software solutions to specialized software providers or data analytics services. This strategy allows organizations to reposition themselves to capture value where it is emerging.

### Ecosystem Orchestration

Successful re-aggregation often involves orchestrating a network of partners. This requires a shift from controlling all aspects of the value chain to influencing and coordinating a broader ecosystem. Platform business models are a common outcome of this.

### Competitive Dynamics Redefined

This strategy can fundamentally alter the competitive landscape. It can lower barriers to entry for new, specialized players, and force incumbents to rethink their entire business model. Organizations that master disaggregation and re-aggregation can often redefine the rules of the game in their industry.

## ❓ **Key Questions to Ask**

- **Value Creation:** Where is value truly created in our current value chain, and where is it being destroyed or underleveraged?
- **Modularity:** Which parts of our value chain could be separated and managed as independent modules?
- **External Opportunities:** What new technologies, partners, or market needs could we address by disaggregating and re-aggregating?
- **Competitive Threats:** How are competitors or new entrants using disaggregated models to challenge us?
- **Capabilities:** Do we have the internal skills and culture to manage a more modular, ecosystem-driven business model?
- **Risk Appetite:** Are we prepared for the level of disruption and uncertainty that this strategy entails?
- **Future Vision:** What does our industry's value chain look like in 5-10 years, and how can we shape it to our advantage?
