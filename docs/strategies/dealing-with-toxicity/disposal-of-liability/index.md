# Disposal of Liability

**Eliminating toxic or obsolete components from your value chain to reduce drag and reclaim focus.**

> *"Overcoming the internal inertia to disposal. Your own organisation is likely to fight you even when you're trying to get
id of the toxic."*
>
> - Simon Wardley

## ü§î **Explanation**

### What is Disposal of Liability?
Disposal of Liability is the strategic removal of components, such as products, services, or operations, that have become
burdensome or harmful to an organization‚Äôs evolution. These components may be outdated, costly to maintain, or generate inertia
that hinders growth and innovation.

### Why use Disposal of Liability?
Eliminating liabilities frees resources (financial, human, and strategic) to focus on higher-value activities. It reduces
complexity, cuts maintenance costs, and mitigates risks associated with obsolete or non-strategic assets.

### How to use Disposal of Liability?
Begin by mapping your value chain to identify components that are no longer evolving or are causing drag. Evaluate their cost,
risk, and strategic fit. Develop a disposal plan, which may include divestiture, shutdown, or sale. Secure leadership buy-in,
communicate with stakeholders, and manage the transition carefully.

## üó∫Ô∏è **Real-World Examples**

### IBM‚Äôs PC Division Sale to Lenovo (2005)
IBM sold its commoditized PC division to Lenovo to shed a low-margin business and focus on services and software, enabling it
to reallocate resources to higher-growth areas.

### Kodak‚Äôs Film Business (1990s)
Kodak struggled to divest its legacy film operations in time, highlighting how delayed disposal can lead to missed
opportunities and decline.

### Telecom Copper Network Decommissioning (Hypothetical)
A telecom operator divests its legacy copper infrastructure to a specialized firm, reducing maintenance costs and allowing
investment in broadband and wireless networks.

  <MapSignals>
    <li>Our map shows key components stuck in a mature or commodity stage.</li>
    <li>Maintaining these components ties up significant resources.</li>
    <li>Internal teams resist moving away from established but unproductive assets.</li>

    <li>We have legal and operational plans for divestment or shutdown.</li>
  </Readiness>
</Assessment>

**Use when:** A part of your value chain is mature or commoditized, draining resources, and the cost of maintaining it
utweighs the benefits, and you have leadership support for disposal.

**Avoid when:** The asset still generates critical revenue that funds your strategic initiatives, or you lack the authority or
stakeholder alignment to execute a disposal plan.

## üéØ **Leadership**

### Core challenge
Navigating internal resistance and ensuring organizational alignment when proposing the removal of long-standing assets that
employees and customers may be attached to.

### Key leadership skills required
- Decisive stakeholder management
- Clear communication and storytelling
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Change management and negotiation

### Ethical considerations
Ensure that disposal does not abandon stakeholders, such as employees, customers, or communities. Plan for fair treatment,
severance, or transition support.

## üìã **How to Execute**

1. Map and identify liabilities in your value chain.
2. Evaluate cost, risk, and strategic fit of each component.
3. Develop a disposal plan (divestiture, shutdown, or sale).
4. Secure leadership buy-in and align stakeholders.
5. Execute the disposal steps with clear communication.
6. Manage transition and monitor outcomes.

## üìà **Measuring Success**

- Reduction in maintenance and operational costs.
- Resources reallocated to strategic initiatives.
- Percentage of legacy components successfully removed.
- Improvement in organizational agility and focus.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfalls and Warning Signs**

### Underestimating hidden costs
Disposal can incur unforeseen expenses‚Äîlegal fees, severance, or environmental cleanup‚Äîthat jeopardize the plan.

### Insufficient stakeholder engagement
Lack of communication or support from key groups can lead to pushback, delays, or sabotage.

### Legal and contractual oversights
Ignoring contractual obligations or regulatory requirements can result in fines or lawsuits.

### Loss of critical capabilities
Removing a component too quickly may deprive the organization of essential skills or knowledge.

## üß† **Strategic Insights**

### Evolution acceleration
Removing outdated components accelerates organizational evolution by clearing bottlenecks.

### Organizational focus
Disposal clarifies strategy, directing attention and investment toward future-facing initiatives.

### Risk concentration
While disposal reduces systemic drag, it can concentrate risk if overused or poorly planned.

## ‚ùì **Key Questions to Ask**

- What assets are dragging our evolution?
- Where are we investing resources to maintain obsolete components?
- Who will be affected by disposal and how will we support them?
- Do we have authority and resources to execute the disposal?
- What is the timeline and criteria for success?
