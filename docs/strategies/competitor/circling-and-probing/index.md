# Circling and Probing

:::note
**Circling and Probing** isn't explicitly mentioned in Wardley's [On 61 differnt forms of gameplay](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2015/05/on-61-different-forms-of-gameplay.html).
:::

**Testing the waters in a competitor‚Äôs territory through small-scale incursions.**

This strategy involves making small, tentative moves into a competitor's space to test their reactions and identify opportunities.

## ü§î **Explanation**

### What is Circling and Probing

Circling and probing is a strategy of making small-scale incursions into a competitor's market to explore opportunities and assess the competitive landscape. Instead of a direct attack, a company observes from the periphery, launching experimental offerings to uncover unmet needs or competitor weaknesses.

### Why is Circling and Probing a valuable leadership strategy?

Circling and probing is valuable because it allows a company to:

* Learn and map the competitive landscape
* Gauge a competitor's reaction speed
* Identify opportunities to exploit
* Test the market's receptivity

This approach reduces risk by using low-cost, low-commitment experiments to gather intelligence before making larger investments.

### How?

The core idea is competitive exploration. A company tests the opponent's defenses and customer response through small experiments (pilot programs, beta products, limited releases). By observing how the market and competitors respond, the company gains insights to inform future actions. This strategy is about learning and adaptation, allowing for adjustments based on the intelligence gathered.

## üö¶ **When to Use / When to Avoid**

<Assessment strategyName="Circling and Probing">
  <MapSignals>
    <li>We see a valuable market or user segment currently served by a competitor, but with unclear user satisfaction or unmet needs.</li>
    <li>The competitor is strong but not invulnerable‚Äîthere are signs of pricing, experience, or agility constraints.</li>
    <li>Our map shows this area as adjacent to our current value chain but not yet fully mapped or explored.</li>
    <li>The opportunity is uncertain or unvalidated, making a full-scale commitment premature.</li>
    <li>We anticipate market change or inflection but need more insight before committing.</li>
    <li>We would benefit from learning how the competitor reacts to unexpected moves or new offerings.</li>
  </MapSignals>
  <Readiness>
    <li>We have the ability to rapidly create small-scale offerings (e.g., MVPs, limited pilots, betas).</li>
    <li>We are culturally comfortable with controlled experimentation and learning through doing.</li>
    <li>We can instrument and evaluate low-commitment probes to gain actionable intelligence.</li>
    <li>We have the discipline to avoid premature scaling or overinterpreting small signals.</li>
    <li>Our teams understand the distinction between core execution and experimental probes.</li>
    <li>We can adapt quickly based on new intelligence gathered through market testing.</li>
    <li>We have clear strategic intent guiding what we want to learn or provoke from the competitor.</li>
  </Readiness>
</Assessment>

### Use when

Circling and probing is useful for:

* Testing the waters in a competitor's territory
* Identifying unmet needs or weaknesses in a competitor's offerings
* Reducing uncertainty before a major commitment
* Operating in fast-evolving markets

### Avoid when

* There is a need for immediate, decisive action
* The competitor is highly vulnerable and can be easily defeated
* The risks associated with provoking a competitor outweigh the potential benefits of probing

## üó∫Ô∏è **Real-World Examples**

* **Netflix‚Äôs Entry into Gaming:** Netflix began its move into the gaming market with small steps. It added mobile games for subscribers and experimented with streaming games on TVs and PCs in limited beta tests. This probed a market dominated by console and PC game providers. By assessing user interest and technological feasibility on a small scale, Netflix circled the gaming industry without a large upfront investment.
* **Google‚Äôs Trial Products:** Google frequently launches beta products or services in areas where a competitor is strong. For example, Google+ in social networking (Facebook‚Äôs territory) and Google Wave for collaboration (rivaling emerging enterprise tools). These efforts served as exploratory probes. Google+ allowed Google to learn about social media user behavior and integrate features into other products.
* **Amazon‚Äôs Beta Offerings:** Amazon has a history of testing new business ideas in limited regions or with trials, such as grocery delivery and fashion (e.g., Amazon Pantry, Prime Wardrobe beta). These probes gauge demand in markets dominated by others (like supermarkets or apparel retailers). Promising results lead to scaling up, while limited risk and cost are incurred if results are poor.

## üéØ **Leadership**

### Core challenge

Leaders must balance a **curious, data-driven mindset** with a tolerance for ambiguity. They should foster an environment where small experiments are encouraged and failures are acceptable.

### Key leadership skills required

* Strategic thinking
* Adaptability
* Risk management
* Clear communication

## üìã **How to Execute**

1.  **Define the hypothesis:** Clearly state what you aim to learn from the probe.
2.  **Develop a minimal viable offering:** Create something that can be launched quickly and with limited investment, yet is sufficient to attract users and generate feedback.
3.  **Target strategically:** Use geographic or demographic targeting to limit exposure.
4.  **Instrument for learning:** Set metrics and collect qualitative feedback to maximize learning.
5.  **Maintain a low profile:** Avoid alerting competitors or setting high customer expectations.
6.  **Evaluate results:** Assess whether the probe uncovered demand or vulnerabilities.
7.  **Integrate learnings:** Use the insights gained to inform future strategies.

### Ethical considerations

Circling and probing should be conducted ethically, respecting competitors' intellectual property and avoiding deceptive practices.

## üìà **Measuring Success**

* Learning objectives met: Did the probe provide the intended insights?
* Cost-effectiveness: Were the probes conducted with minimal investment?
* Competitor reaction: Did the competitor's response provide valuable intelligence?
* Market validation: Did the probe identify potential opportunities?
* Speed of iteration: How quickly can the organization adapt based on probe results?
* Risk mitigation: Did the probe prevent a larger, more costly mistake?
* Strategic alignment: How well do the probe's findings inform overall strategy?
* Knowledge acquisition: What new knowledge was gained about the market and competitors?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfalls and Warning Signs**

### Overconfidence

Underestimating a competitor's strengths or overestimating the probe's potential impact.

### Analysis paralysis

Getting stuck in continuous probing without taking decisive action based on the insights gained.

### Premature scaling

Scaling up a probe before fully understanding its implications or the market's response.

## üß† **Strategic Insights**

### Reducing Uncertainty

Circling and probing reduces uncertainty before making major commitments. It helps avoid costly missteps by revealing market attractiveness and competitor strengths.

### Psychological Impact

Small probes can unsettle competitors, causing them to overreact or spread their focus.

### Complementary Strategies

Probing can be combined with other strategies, such as misdirection or a follow-up Tech Drop, to increase effectiveness.

### Organizational Alignment

Ensure employees understand the difference between core business efforts and probes to avoid neglect.

### Action Orientation

Avoid getting stuck in analysis; the goal is to use insights to decide where to invest.
