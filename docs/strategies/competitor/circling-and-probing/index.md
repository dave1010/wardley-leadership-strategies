# Circling and probing

Circling and Probing
--------------------

### Explanation

“Circling and Probing” is a strategy of **testing the waters in a competitor’s territory through small-scale incursions**. Rather than a full-frontal attack, the company circles a rival’s market space – observing from the edges – and **launches experimental offerings to probe unmet needs or weaknesses**. The idea is to **learn and map the competitive landscape** by seeing how the market and the competitor respond to minor challenges. These probes are often low-cost, low-commitment experiments (pilot programs, beta products, limited releases) aimed at gathering intelligence. By circling a competitor’s domain and probing it, a company can identify opportunities to exploit or gauge the rival’s reaction speed without fully exposing itself. In essence, this is **competitive exploration**: you’re feeling out the opponent’s defenses and the customer’s receptivity before deciding on a larger offensive move.

### Real-World Examples

*   **Netflix’s Entry into Gaming:** Netflix, primarily a streaming video company, began **testing the gaming market with small steps**. It added a few mobile games for subscribers and later experimented with streaming games on TVs and PCs in limited beta tests. This is a probe into a space dominated by console and PC game providers. By gauging user interest and technological feasibility on a small scale, Netflix circles the gaming industry without a massive upfront investment. The insights from this probe will inform whether and how Netflix commits more seriously to game streaming, all while competitors like Microsoft or Sony watch carefully but can’t be sure of Netflix’s ultimate intentions.
    
*   **Google’s Trial Products:** Google often launches beta products or services in areas where a competitor is strong – for example, Google+ in social networking (Facebook’s territory) or Google Wave for collaboration (rivaling emerging enterprise tools). These efforts, while some eventually failed or were shut down, served as **exploratory probes**. Google+ allowed Google to learn about social media user behavior and integrate valuable features (like circles and photo sharing) into other products. Similarly, by launching an experimental product in a competitor’s domain, a company can collect user data, test new tech, and even _influence the competitor’s strategy_ (competitors might react to the experiment, possibly over-committing or revealing their playbook).
    
*   **Amazon’s Beta Offerings:** Amazon has a history of quietly testing new business ideas – from grocery delivery to fashion – often in limited regions or with invitation-only trials (e.g. Amazon Pantry, Invite-only Prime Wardrobe beta). These **probes gauge demand** in markets dominated by others (like supermarkets or apparel retailers). If results are promising, Amazon then scales up (as it did with Amazon Fresh after years of pilots). If not, the risk and cost were limited. Meanwhile, incumbents might not treat the small experiment as an existential threat until Amazon has learned enough to expand, at which point Amazon has a refined approach.
    

### Leadership

From a leadership perspective, circling and probing requires a **curious, data-driven mindset** and tolerance for ambiguity. Leaders should foster an environment where **small experiments are encouraged and failures are acceptable** (since not every probe will succeed). This approach is inherently iterative – leadership must be willing to adapt strategy based on what the probes reveal. Key responsibilities of leadership here include: selecting the right “probes” (choosing experiments that target areas of competitor weakness or unexplored customer needs), allocating a protected budget and team for these exploratory projects, and setting **clear learning objectives** for each probe (e.g., “We will launch Product X in a test market to see if customers will adopt a simpler, cheaper version of Competitor’s offering.”). Leaders also need to keep the broader organization aligned: even while a probe runs, core business must not be neglected. Communication is nuanced – internally, teams should know that these probes are strategic learning tools; externally, leaders often keep probes low-profile to avoid alerting competitors or setting high customer expectations. In sum, leadership should be patient and **strategically opportunistic** – ready to double down on experiments that show promise and gracefully exit those that don’t, all while learning from each outcome.

### Execution

Executing a circling and probing strategy involves disciplined experimentation. First, define the **hypothesis to test**: for example, “Will customers buy a stripped-down version of our competitor’s product if we offer it at 50% price?” or “Is there a niche segment whose needs aren’t met by the incumbent’s service?” Once the probe’s goal is clear, develop a **minimal viable offering** – something that can be launched quickly and with modest investment, yet is good enough to attract real users and yield feedback. Geographic or demographic targeting is useful; you might release the experimental offering in a secondary market or to a subset of users to limit exposure. Next, instrument the probe for **maximum learning** – set metrics (sign-ups, usage, conversion, churn) and collect qualitative feedback. While the probe is active, keep a **low profile** strategically; you’re circling the competitor quietly. If the competitor notices and reacts (for instance, by offering discounts or rushing out a similar feature), that reaction itself is valuable intelligence about their priorities and agility. After a set period, **evaluate the results**. Did the probe uncover strong demand or vulnerabilities in the competitor’s position? If yes, you might iterate on the offering or prepare a bigger launch. If not, extract lessons and either pivot the experiment or shut it down without heavy losses. Execution should be nimble: small dedicated teams, short development cycles, and the ability to rapidly change course based on what is learned. Finally, integrate the learnings into your strategic plan – successful probes might graduate into full products or even inform an ambush or fragmentation play later. In essence, execution is about **learning fast and cheap** while keeping the opponent guessing.

### Strategic Insights

Circling and probing serves as reconnaissance in the business battlefield. One strategic insight is that it **reduces uncertainty before a major commitment**. By probing a competitor’s space, you may discover that the market isn’t as attractive as it appears or that the competitor has unseen strengths, saving you from a costly misstep. Alternatively, you might find a sweet spot that the competitor overlooks, which can become your point of entry. Another insight is the psychological aspect: a series of small probes can unnerve competitors. They may become unsure which experiment of yours will turn into a serious threat, potentially causing them to spread their focus thin or react prematurely. This strategy also complements other plays – for instance, you might combine probing with misdirection (making a probe look serious to prompt overreaction) or with a **follow-up Ambush** (once your probe identifies a ripe opportunity, you execute a big tech drop to capitalize on it). Leaders should be cautious not to confuse the organization: ensure that employees understand the difference between core business efforts and experimental probes so neither is neglected. Moreover, avoid getting **stuck in analysis paralysis** – the end goal is to act on the insights gained. Probing is a means to decide where to fight or invest heavily. Strategically, it’s an excellent approach in fast-evolving markets or against incumbents that are unsure how to respond to novel offerings. By the time your competitor figures out which probe of yours really matters, you’ll have built up knowledge and perhaps a foothold that’s difficult to dislodge.
