# User Perception

User perception strategies shape how users see value, choice and change.

You use *education* to overcome inertia or *FUD* to slow others. You can manipulate behaviour with *bundling*, *artificial needs*, or by *confusing choice*. These are subtle but powerful. Often the battle isn’t over what’s better, but what users *believe* is better.

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
