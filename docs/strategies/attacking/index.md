# Attacking

Attacking plays are used to force change in the market. You're not waiting for evolution, you're deliberately driving it.

This can mean undermining barriers, running experiments, or concentrating talent to trigger gravity.

Attacking is most useful when you're trying to break inertia, dislodge incumbents, or reposition the landscape. Itâ€™s proactive and often high-risk but can yield rapid dominance.
