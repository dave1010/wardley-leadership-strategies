# Directed investment


**Directed Investment**

**Definition & Summary:** Making a **targeted, venture-capital-style investment in a future change or emerging area** to outpace rivals . Think of it as placing a strategic bet: you funnel resources (money, talent, R&D) into a specific innovation or market you've identified as crucial.

**Detailed Explanation:** Instead of spreading resources thin or waiting, you *direct* a substantial investment into something you believe will be key (like AI, quantum, a new market segment). Wardley likens it to a VC approach -- high-risk, high-reward bets on the future . Purpose: **seize first mover or intellectual lead** in that change, so when it matures, you are ahead and competitors are scrambling. Origins: corporate venturing, where companies create internal funds or initiatives (like Google X, or corporate VC arms) to pursue disruptive ideas. Key principle: identify the "where" (the future shift) from mapping climate patterns, then commit significant resources early.

**Real-World Examples:**

-  *Historical:* **Google's early investment in DeepMind (2014)** -- Google saw the rising importance of AI and directed large investment by acquiring DeepMind (and also funding brain-like AI research internally). This directed investment gave Google a major lead in AI talent and tech, outpacing rivals in the AI arms race. It was a bet that AI would underpin future products (which it has, in search, voice, etc.).

-  *Historical:* **Bell Labs by AT&T (mid 20th century)** -- AT&T essentially directed a chunk of its monopoly profits into Bell Labs to invent the future (transistors, satellites, etc.). This was more R&D than VC, but it was targeted investment in fundamental innovations that kept AT&T ahead in telecom tech for decades. They identified areas like semiconductor research and poured money in, yielding inventions that others couldn't easily match.

-  *Hypothetical:* A retail giant anticipates that **AR/VR shopping** will be a game-changer. It creates a $200M fund and innovation center specifically for AR commerce -- hiring AR developers, partnering with headset makers, experimenting with virtual stores. This is a directed investment aimed at owning the space of AR shopping before Amazon or others do. If they succeed, when AR shopping becomes viable, they'll have the tech and experience advantage.

**When to Use / When to Avoid:**

-  **Use when:** You have identified a **strategic inevitable** (through mapping's climatic patterns or weak signals) -- a change that's likely to come and can disrupt the industry if you're not leading. Also use if you have resources to spare for long-term plays. This is ideal when competitors are asleep at the wheel or hesitant -- your directed investment can leapfrog you. It's often used by visionary leadership ("we bet on X being the future").

-  **Avoid when:** The future area is highly uncertain and you might burn cash for nothing (directed investment is risky -- if you bet wrong, you lose investment and time). If your core business is under immediate threat, diverting too much resource could be dangerous (sometimes focusing on shoring up present is more critical). Also avoid if you lack the culture to manage an exploratory effort (directed investments can fail if the parent org stifles them or expects quick ROI).

**Common Pitfalls:**

-  **Betting on the wrong horse:** It's possible to identify a trend that doesn't pan out or that someone else cracks in a different way. Big directed investments have failed (e.g., companies that bet on VR too early in the 90s).

-  **Isolation or integration issues:** If the investment is kept too separate (skunkworks), it might not transition well into core business when needed (the classic "innovator's dilemma" problem). Alternatively, if not separate enough, the core can meddle and kill the innovation. Striking the right balance is hard.

-  **Financial strain:** Large investments can strain even big companies if the timeline is long. If the future arrives later than expected, you might have to sustain funding for longer, which can test stakeholder patience.

**Related Strategies:** **Weak Signal & Horizon Scanning** (directed investment often follows detecting weak signals of change ), **First Mover** (it's a method to achieve first mover advantage by investing early), **Center of Gravity** (sometimes directed investment is about creating a hub of talent in the new field, related concept).

**Further Reading & References:**

-  Wardley, S. -- *"VC approach to a specific identified future change"* . Clearly frames directed investment as a strategic play of betting on future shifts identified via mapping.

-  Book: **"The Innovator's Dilemma" (Christensen)** -- while it warns of focusing too much on current needs, it implicitly supports the idea of directed separate investments to capture disruptive innovations (i.e., creating a division to explore the disruptive tech).

-  Corporate examples: Amazon's heavy investment in Alexa/voice AI mid-2010s (they put huge resources into voice assistant tech anticipating voice computing -- now Alexa is a leader, though monetization is evolving) -- lots of tech journalism on this as Amazon's big bet.
