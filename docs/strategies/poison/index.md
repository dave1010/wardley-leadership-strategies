# Poison

The Poison play is about strategic sabotage. If you can’t or don’t want to dominate a future space, you can still deny it to others.

Poison tactics shape perception, introduce friction, or distort incentives, making the space unattractive, unstable, or unviable. It’s a scorched earth approach—used to derail a competitor’s roadmap, destroy a nascent ecosystem, or stall innovation that threatens your position.

Poison isn’t about winning. It’s about ensuring no one else does.
