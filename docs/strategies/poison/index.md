# Poison

The Poison play is about strategic sabotage. If you can’t or don’t want to dominate a future space, you can still deny it to others.

Poison tactics shape perception, introduce friction, or distort incentives, making the space unattractive, unstable, or unviable. It’s a scorched earth approach—used to derail a competitor’s roadmap, destroy a nascent ecosystem, or stall innovation that threatens your position.

Poison isn’t about winning. It’s about ensuring no one else does.

## Comparison of Poison Strategies

| Strategy & Link                                            | Primary Goal/Intent                                                                 | Key Mechanisms                                                                                                | Typical Use Cases/Scenarios                                                                                                   | Main Benefits (for the User of Poison)                                                                                                     | Key Climatic Patterns                                                                                                                                 |

| [Designed to Fail](/strategies/poison/designed-to-fail/)   | Ensure a competitor's project or initiative is unsuccessful by subtle sabotage.     | Introducing flaws, withholding critical information/support, setting unrealistic expectations, mismanaging resources. | When directly opposing a project is not feasible; to undermine a competitor's new venture or product launch without overt aggression. | Competitor's initiative fails, resources wasted by competitor, maintains status quo or your relative advantage.                                  | [Competitors actions will change the game](/climatic-patterns/competitors-actions-will-change-the-game), [Most competitors have poor situational awareness](/climatic-patterns/most-competitors-have-poor-situational-awareness) |
| [Insertion](/strategies/poison/insertion/)                 | Introduce elements into a competitor's system or ecosystem that cause harm or instability. | Planting misinformation, introducing incompatible components, fostering dissent in communities, exploiting vulnerabilities. | To disrupt competitor operations, discredit their offerings, or create internal conflict within their ecosystem.                | Competitor instability, loss of trust in competitor's offerings, slowing competitor's progress.                                                  | [Characteristics change](/climatic-patterns/characteristics-change) (negatively for the target), [Inertia can kill an organisation](/climatic-patterns/inertia-can-kill-an-organisation) (if they can't adapt to the poison) |
| [Licensing](/strategies/poison/licensing/)                 | Use restrictive or complex licensing terms to hinder adoption or use by others.     | Predatory licensing, complex legal terms, high fees for critical components, FUD around IPR.                      | To make a competitor's product unviable, to slow adoption of an open standard you wish to control or supersede.             | Reduced competition, increased dependency on your alternatives, revenue generation through punitive licensing.                                 | [Capital flows to new areas of value](/climatic-patterns/capital-flows-to-new-areas-of-value) (away from poisoned area), [IPR as a decelerator (implicit)] |
