# Licensing

**Leveraging legal frameworks to restrict competitor use and lock in ecosystems.**

> *"Use of licensing to prevent future competitor moves."*

## ü§î **Explanation**

### What is Licensing?

Licensing uses legal agreements like patents, copyrights, or trademarks, to control how others can use, modify, or distribute a technology or component. Terms may include field-of-use restrictions, revocable licenses, or dual-licensing models.

:::note

**Licensing** uses legal agreements (licenses) to control how others can use, modify, or distribute your technology. The "poison" aspect refers to structuring licenses in a way that restricts competitors‚Äîsuch as limiting use cases, requiring fees, or imposing terms that make it hard for rivals to compete or switch away. The focus is on actively shaping the ecosystem and locking in users or partners through legal terms.

This uses similar tools but is distinct from [Patents & IPR](/strategies/decelerators/ipr), which focuses on creating legal barriers that slow down competitors' innovation. Licensing is about controlling usage through agreements, while IPR is about preventing access or use altogether.

### Why use Licensing?

By structuring licenses strategically, you can:

- Deter competitor entry into critical domains.
- Create revenue streams via commercial licensing.
- Lock in partners or customers through exclusive rights.

## üó∫Ô∏è **Real-World Examples**

### MySQL Dual Licensing

Oracle‚Äôs MySQL offers GPL-licensed open source and paid proprietary licenses. Projects requiring commercial terms must purchase a license, generating revenue and controlling adoption.

### Android Open Source Project

Google releases Android under open-source licenses but retains key services under proprietary licenses, guiding ecosystem development under its terms.

### Use when

- You need to protect core innovations from competitor replication.
- Licensing creates a significant revenue or strategic barrier.
- Enforcement costs are justified by long-term gains.

### Avoid when

- Open ecosystems and rapid innovation outweigh tight control.
- Community backlash or forks could undermine core assets.
- Legal risks or enforcement costs exceed benefits.

## üéØ **Leadership**

### Core challenge

Crafting license terms that effectively deter competitors without alienating legitimate users or developers.

### Key leadership skills required

- Legal strategy and IP management
- Negotiation and contract drafting
- Ecosystem engagement
- Risk and compliance oversight

### Ethical considerations

Overly restrictive licensing can stifle innovation and erode trust. Leaders should assess broader community impact and balance control with collaboration.

## üìã **How to Execute**

1. Audit core IP assets and dependencies.
2. Define strategic objectives for licensing (protection, revenue, lock-in).
3. Select license models: field-of-use, dual-licensing, revocable.
4. Draft clear, enforceable terms with legal counsel.
5. Communicate licensing strategy transparently to partners and community.
6. Monitor compliance and enforce agreements when necessary.
7. Review and iterate licenses as market and technology evolve.

## üìà **Measuring Success**

- Reduced competitor use or replication of core assets.
- Licensing revenue and renewal rates.
- Partner and customer satisfaction under license terms.
- Legal enforcement outcomes.
- Sustained market share and ecosystem stability.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfalls and Warning Signs**

### Over-Complexity

Excessively detailed terms can deter all adopters, including loyal partners.

### Legal Backfire

Aggressive enforcement invites litigation and negative publicity.

### Community Alienation

Open-source communities may fork or abandon overly restrictive licenses.

### Market Fragmentation

Excessive restrictions may create incompatible ecosystems.

## üß† **Strategic Insights**

### Dual-Licensing Leverage

Dual-licensing can serve as a Trojan horse for commercial adoption.

### Patent Thickets

Dense patent portfolios deter entry but may slow broader innovation.

### Evolving Commoditization

Licenses must adapt as technologies become commodities to maintain relevance.

## ‚ùì **Key Questions to Ask**

- **Dependency:** Which of our assets are critical bottlenecks in the map?
- **Leverage:** How can license terms create sustainable competitive advantage?
- **Risk:** What is the litigation and reputational risk?
- **Balance:** How do we maintain community goodwill while enforcing control?
- **Evolution:** How will our licensing model adapt to market changes?
