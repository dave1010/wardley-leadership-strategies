Licensing can weaponise control. By offering components or IP under restrictive terms (e.g. field-of-use limitations, revocable licences, patents with traps), you can limit how others build or scale.

It creates a honeypot effect, drawing in others, only to trap them later. You appear open, but retain kill switches. Done right, it deters entry without obvious aggression.

Ask: does your open strategy leave room for others to enclose? If yes, you’re vulnerable to this.

- Patents & IPR (Deaccelerators): Directly aligned — both create legal or contractual friction to prevent progress.
- Limitation of competition (Deaccelerators): Licensing can raise structural barriers under the guise of openness.
- Standards game (Market): You can push a “standard” with restrictive licensing to sabotage adoption or fragment competitors.
- Open Approaches (Accelerators): The inverse — restrictive licensing mimics openness but denies the benefits.
- Defensive regulation (Defensive): You might lobby for licensing terms to become regulatory expectations.
