# Insertion

**Embedding agents or narratives to covertly steer competitors into suboptimal strategic decisions.**

> *"Either through talent or misdirection, encouraging false moves in a competitor."*
>
> - Simon Wardley

## 🤔 **Explanation**

### What is Insertion?

Insertion involves placing or influencing individuals, partnerships, or narratives within a competitor’s ecosystem to distort their decision-making processes.

- Personnel insertion: hiring or partnering to embed subtle biases.
- Narrative insertion: seeding hype or misinformation through media and analysts.
- Partnership insertion: shaping joint ventures or alliances to create diversions.

### Why use Insertion?

This strategy allows you to:

- Divert competitor resources into unproductive paths.
- Create uncertainty in rival decision-making.
- Gain indirect control over market narratives and priorities.

## 🗺️ **Real-World Examples**

### Reverse Mentoring in Tech

A dominant platform hires open-source advocates to slow feature rollouts or introduce bureaucratic hurdles, delaying competitor innovation.

### Hypothetical Market Analyst Campaign

You contract analysts to publish optimistic forecasts about a competitor’s nascent technology, prompting them to over-invest in an unproven niche.

## 🚦 **When to Use / When to Avoid**

<Assessment strategyName="Insertion">
  <MapSignals>
    <li>The map shows a competitor gaining momentum in a key component or capability.</li>
    <li>They rely on specialized talent or strategic partnerships you can influence.</li>
    <li>Their decision-making processes are reactive to external narratives.</li>
    <li>There is opacity in their governance or community structures.</li>
  </MapSignals>
  <Readiness>
    <li>We have access to channels for covert influence (hires, media, partnerships).</li>
    <li>We can maintain plausible deniability to avoid detection.</li>
    <li>We can monitor the competitor’s internal decisions indirectly.</li>
    <li>We understand regulatory and ethical boundaries of influence operations.</li>
  </Readiness>
</Assessment>

### Use when

- A competitor’s emerging strength needs early distortion.
- You have channels to embed or influence without quick exposure.
- Indirect control yields more value than direct competitive moves.

### Avoid when

- Ethical or legal constraints outweigh the strategic benefit.
- The competitor’s ecosystem is transparent and resilient.
- Detection would cause unacceptable reputation or regulatory harm.

## 🎯 **Leadership**

### Core challenge

Maintaining covert operations while measuring impact and avoiding detection or blowback.

### Key leadership skills required

- Covert operations planning
- Narrative and media management
- Intelligence gathering
- Risk and crisis management

### Ethical considerations

Covert influence can breach trust and legal boundaries. Leaders must assess long-term brand and regulatory impacts.

## 📋 **How to Execute**

1. Identify the target competitor and strategic inflection points.
2. Develop an influence plan (personnel, media, partnerships).
3. Insert agents or narratives with plausible roles.
4. Monitor competitor reactions through public signals or insiders.
5. Adapt and amplify successful diversions.
6. Withdraw assets gracefully to minimize detection.

## 📈 **Measuring Success**

- Competitor shifts away from optimal strategic paths.
- Resources allocated by competitor to low-value initiatives.
- Level of uncertainty or delay introduced in their roadmap.
- Minimal detection and exposure of operations.

## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls and Warning Signs**

### Exposure Risks

Discovery leads to legal action, reputational damage, or regulatory scrutiny.

### Counter-Intelligence

Competitors can feed false signals to mislead or detect our operations.

### Overreach

Excessive insertion activities increase complexity and detection likelihood.

### Ineffective Influence

Target may ignore inserted assets or narratives, wasting resources.

## 🧠 **Strategic Insights**

### Evolution Stage

Most effective in mid-evolution domains where decisions are still fluid.

### Counterplay Opportunities

Competitors may create open forums or transparent processes to mitigate hidden influences.

### Synergies with Other Tactics

Combining insertion with misdirection and fragmentation increases uncertainty.

## ❓ **Key Questions to Ask**

- **Target Selection:** Which competitor controls components critical to our map?
- **Access:** Can we infiltrate people or media channels effectively?
- **Deniability:** How will we mask our involvement?
- **Impact Tracking:** What signals will indicate our influence is working?
- **Withdrawal Plan:** How will we remove inserted assets without leaving traces?
