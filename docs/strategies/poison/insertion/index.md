Insertion exploits trust and perception.

You might embed individuals (via hiring, partnerships, or influence) who subtly shift a competitor’s direction, or you flood the narrative with hype to lure them into false investments.

This play distorts their strategy from within or diverts attention to dead ends. It’s often hard to detect until damage is done.
