# Designed to fail

:::warning

This is an **early draft** and isn't yet up to our standard.
You can [contribute improvements](https://github.com/dave1010/wardley-leadership-strategies).

:::


You deliberately create or champion a market initiative that looks promising but is flawed by design. For example an open standard with no governance, a half-baked reference implementation, or an underfunded “community” project.

The goal is to occupy the space so others don’t, then let it collapse. It’s denial through decay.

Useful when you sense a threat emerging in a space you don’t want to contest.

Consider: are you backing something that only looks viable? Could you be caught in someone else’s design-to-fail?
