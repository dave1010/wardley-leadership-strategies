# Designed to Fail

**Intentionally launching flawed initiatives to occupy, fragment, or poison a market before it can pose a threat.**

> *"Removing potential future threats by poisoning a market space before anyone attempts to establish it."*
>
> - Simon Wardley

## 🤔 **Explanation**

### What is Designed to Fail?

This is a strategy of tactical sabotage: deliberately introducing a doomed initiative into an emerging space to distort perception, drain competitor resources, and reduce the likelihood of serious market formation.

The aim isn’t to win the market—it’s to ruin it, or at least delay its maturation until you’re ready.

You might:

- Launch a community standard with governance deadlocks
- Publish an open-source library with scalability flaws
- Fund a startup with unworkable economics that shapes expectations

These efforts occupy mindshare and fragment momentum, discouraging others from investing.


### Why use Designed to Fail?

Deploy this strategy when an adjacent or emerging market may threaten your core position. By seeding a flawed initiative, you can:

- Prevent competitors from gaining traction.
- Channel resources away from more impactful ventures.
- Shape market perceptions to your advantage.

## 🗺️ **Real-World Examples**

### HD DVD Format

Toshiba's HD DVD was launched alongside Blu-ray, fragmenting the high-definition disc market. Although technically competent, lack of studio support and deliberate confusion led to its swift decline, deterring new entrants.

### Hypothetical IoT API

A vendor-funded IoT API with inadequate security standards is released. Early adopters face breaches, tarnishing the space and discouraging competitors from similar efforts.

## 🚦 **When to Use / When to Avoid**

<Assessment strategyName="Designed to Fail">
  <MapSignals>
    <li>An adjacent market is forming, but lacks standards or strong leaders.</li>
    <li>We risk disruption if a serious player takes root there.</li>
    <li>We have the credibility to seed a plausible initiative.</li>
  </MapSignals>
  <Readiness>
    <li>We can resource a short-term launch without long-term dependency.</li>
    <li>We have legal clearance and PR buffers in place.</li>
    <li>We know how to shut it down cleanly.</li>
  </Readiness>
</Assessment>

### Use when

- A threat is emerging in an ungoverned adjacent market.
- We can sustain the initiative long enough to signal occupancy.
- The tactical benefit outweighs the resource cost.

### Avoid when

- The initiative risks being corrected or improved by the community.
- Legal or brand risks outweigh strategic gains.
- Stakeholders demand transparency that undermines the tactic.

## 🎯 **Leadership**

### Core challenge

Leadership tension: Playing dirty without eroding trust or morale. This tactic rewards dispassionate analysis and ruthless prioritisation. Leaders who hesitate to pull the trigger, or can’t contain the fallout, should avoid it.

### Key leadership skills required

- Cold strategic judgment
- Reputational risk calibration
- Legal/PR coordination
- Fast-response governance

### Ethical considerations

This strategy walks a line between cunning and deception. Overuse breeds cynicism inside and outside your oranisation. If discovered, you risk brand damage and trust collapse.


## 📋 **How to Execute**

1. Identify a vulnerable or emerging market segment.
2. Design an initiative with surface credibility but hidden flaws.
3. Launch with marketing or partnerships to appear legitimate.
4. Maintain control over governance and contributions to prevent self-healing.
5. Monitor engagement and competitor responses.
6. Allow the initiative to collapse once competitors are deterred.

## 📈 **Measuring Success**

- Competitors refrain from entering the target space.
- Initiative adoption appears sufficient to signal occupancy.
- Resource expenditure stays within planned bounds.
- Competitors divert resources from strategic projects.

## ⚠️ **Common Pitfalls and Warning Signs**

### Unintended Adoption

Competitors or communities may fix flaws, turning the initiative into a viable offering.

### Rapid Correction

Open-source or industry groups could standardize gaps, neutralizing the tactic.

### Reputational Damage

Exposure of the tactic can erode trust with customers and partners.

### Resource Drain

Maintaining a deceptive initiative may consume more resources than planned.

## 🧠 **Strategic Insights**

### Governance Vacuum is Key

This strategy thrives where no one yet has control. Lack of standards or leadership allows you to shape the narrative and expectations.

### Short Half-life by Design

Plan for decay. If it persists, it’s probably failing as a denial tactic. The goal is to fragment, not build a lasting presence.

### Requires Narrative Dominance

The strategy fails without credible messaging. You must control the narrative to ensure the initiative is seen as *legitimate*, even if it’s fundamentally flawed.

### Best as a Side-Play

Avoid making it core to your roadmap. It’s a blocking move, not a winning move. A well-aimed denial move can delay a threat by years but if you’re always poisoning, you’re never building.

## ❓ **Key Questions to Ask**

- **Threat Identification:** Which adjacent emerging markets pose strategic risks?
- **Sustainability:** Can we maintain a credible surface while embedding flaws?
- **Exit Strategy:** How will we decommission the initiative without collateral damage?
- **Risk-Reward Balance:** Do potential benefits justify reputational and legal risks?
