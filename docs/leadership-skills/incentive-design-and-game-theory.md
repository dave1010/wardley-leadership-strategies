# Incentive design and game theory

The skill of shaping incentives so others behave in ways that reinforce your strategy.

## 🎯 **What it enables**

It improves adoption, cooperation, and the stability of multi-player moves.

## 🧭 **How to build it**

- Model how each player benefits and where incentives misalign.
- Use carrots and constraints to steer behaviour ethically.
- Revisit incentives as the environment evolves.
