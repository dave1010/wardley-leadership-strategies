# Experimentation and learning

The habit of running small, fast tests to validate assumptions and adapt direction.

## 🎯 **What it enables**

It reduces the cost of uncertainty and accelerates insight.

## 🧭 **How to build it**

- Design experiments with clear hypotheses and success criteria.
- Share results openly, including failed experiments.
- Turn learnings into updated maps and decisions quickly.
