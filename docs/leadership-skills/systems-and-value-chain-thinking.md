# Systems and value chain thinking

The skill of seeing how components, dependencies, and incentives interact across the wider landscape.

## 🎯 **What it enables**

It is essential when reshaping value chains, exploiting bottlenecks, or coordinating ecosystems.

## 🧭 **How to build it**

- Map dependencies and identify where control or friction sits today.
- Look for second-order impacts before changing a critical component.
- Review how shifting one node affects partners, suppliers, and users.
