# Strategic sensemaking

The discipline of reading the landscape, interpreting weak signals, and building a coherent view of where a strategy should move next.

## 🎯 **What it enables**

It turns maps, market evidence, and competitive moves into a shared direction before committing scarce resources.

## 🧭 **How to build it**

- Practice mapping cycles that connect user needs, value chains, and evolution stages.
- Review assumptions regularly and document what changed and why.
- Use pre-mortems and scenario thinking to test strategic narratives.
