# Information control and operational security

The ability to protect sensitive plans, timing, or data from leakage and counter-moves.

It prevents competitors from pre-empting aggressive strategies.

## 🧭 **How to build it**

- Limit plan visibility to those who need to execute.
- Use operational checklists to prevent accidental leaks.
- Plan disclosure timing alongside launch execution.
