# Governance and policy design

The capability to define rules, standards, and decision rights that keep complex initiatives coherent.

## 🎯 **What it enables**

## 🧭 **How to build it**

- Clarify who decides what, and how disputes are resolved.
- Use lightweight governance early, then add structure as scale grows.
- Regularly review policies to avoid unintended lock-in or bias.
