# Decision-making under uncertainty

The ability to make timely commitments despite incomplete information and ambiguous signals.

## 🎯 **What it enables**

It balances speed with discipline so the organisation acts before the window closes.

## 🧭 **How to build it**

- Define decision thresholds and pre-agreed triggers before pressure hits.
- Use small probes to reduce uncertainty before larger commitments.
- Document reversible versus irreversible decisions and act accordingly.
