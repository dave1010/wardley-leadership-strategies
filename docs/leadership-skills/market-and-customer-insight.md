A deep understanding of user needs, willingness to pay, and adoption dynamics across segments.

## 🎯 **What it enables**

It keeps strategies anchored in real demand instead of internal narratives.

## 🧭 **How to build it**

- Use interviews and journey mapping to uncover unmet needs and switching costs.
- Validate assumptions with pricing, conversion, or demand experiments.
- Track shifts in buyer power, substitutes, and procurement behaviour.
