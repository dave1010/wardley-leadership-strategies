# Community and ecosystem stewardship

The capability to foster healthy communities and balance interests across ecosystem participants.

## 🎯 **What it enables**

It keeps shared platforms vibrant and resilient.

## 🧭 **How to build it**

- Invest in community feedback loops and transparent contribution rules.
- Reward behaviours that strengthen the ecosystem, not just the platform owner.
- Protect against dominant players that distort shared value.
