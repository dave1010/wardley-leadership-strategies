# Competitive intelligence

The ability to track competitors, infer intent, and anticipate moves without relying on speculation.

## 🎯 **What it enables**

It helps leaders time attacks, defend positions, and choose counterplay with precision.

## 🧭 **How to build it**

- Build a cadence for monitoring market signals, hiring shifts, and product changes.
- Separate evidence from assumptions and capture confidence levels explicitly.
- Share insights early so teams can rehearse responses before surprises hit.
