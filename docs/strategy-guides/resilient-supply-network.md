# Resilient Supply Network Field Guide

Supply shocks are inevitable; the organisations that thrive turn mapping insight into deliberate redundancy and leverage. This field guide weaves [Buyer-Supplier Power](/strategies/markets/buyer-supplier-power), [Creating Constraints](/strategies/decelerators/creating-constraints), and [Threat Acquisition](/strategies/defensive/threat-acquisition) into a repeatable cycle that stabilises your supply base without suffocating innovation.

## 🗺️ **Map Critical Dependencies End-to-End**

Begin with a Wardley Map that traces the entire flow from raw inputs to customer outcomes. Highlight components with single points of failure or lead times that dwarf customer tolerance. Classify suppliers by evolution stage: genesis partners demand joint exploration, while commodity vendors should be interchangeable. This visual clarity reveals where concentration risk hides behind otherwise healthy metrics.

## 🔀 **Rebalance Power Dynamics Intentionally**

Apply [Buyer-Supplier Power](/strategies/markets/buyer-supplier-power) to negotiate from a position of insight rather than fear. Where suppliers dominate, increase optionality: cultivate alternate vendors, invest in automation, or redesign the product so that a bespoke part becomes a utility. Where you hold leverage, avoid complacency by offering long-term commitments tied to performance metrics that reinforce mutual resilience.

## 🧱 **Introduce Smart Constraints**

Use [Creating Constraints](/strategies/decelerators/creating-constraints) to slow down risky expansions while you fortify the base. Cap order volumes in markets prone to bullwhip effects, require dual-sourcing for components above a defined risk threshold, and set decision gates that demand fresh map reviews before major supplier switches. Constraints are not bureaucracy; they are shock absorbers that keep teams honest about risk trade-offs.

## 🛡️ **Acquire Threats Before They Erupt**

Some bottlenecks will not budge through negotiation alone. Deploy [Threat Acquisition](/strategies/defensive/threat-acquisition) selectively to buy capabilities that jeopardise continuity—specialist tooling firms, niche data providers, or regional logistics hubs. When acquisition is impractical, pursue [Alliances](/strategies/ecosystem/alliances) that give you veto power over critical decisions. Integrate these moves into your map so you can see how the supply network evolves post-deal.

## 🧪 **Institutionalise Stress Testing**

Schedule recurring war games that simulate supplier failure, regulatory shocks, or transportation breakdowns. Feed the scenarios into your maps and document the decision playbooks that emerge. Pair these exercises with real-world telemetry—inventory buffers, supplier financial health, and lead-time variance—so you can trigger contingency plans early. The goal is to make resilience a muscle, not a one-off project.

## 📈 **Measure Resilience as a Portfolio**

Track composite indicators: percentage of spend under dual-source coverage, average time to re-route production, revenue concentration by supplier, and the cadence of map refreshes. When a metric drifts, convene the cross-functional team responsible for the guide and update both constraints and acquisition targets. Over time, this discipline shifts the organisation from reacting to supply shocks to shaping the market on its own terms.
