# AI Transformation Navigator

AI promises step-change performance, but unmanaged hype burns capital and trust. This navigator blends [Experimentation](/strategies/attacking/experimentation), [Directed Investment](/strategies/attacking/directed-investment), and the [Press Release Process](/strategies/attacking/press-release-process) with adoption plays like [Education](/strategies/user-perception/education) so leaders can industrialise AI responsibly.

## 🧪 **Frame the Right Experiments**

Resist the urge to automate everything at once. Map the customer journey and internal workflows to spot high-friction steps where AI can relieve cognitive load. Launch tightly scoped proofs of value using [Experimentation](/strategies/attacking/experimentation): define success metrics, capture qualitative feedback, and sunset trials that fail to deliver. Keep experiments in the differentiating zone until reliability is proven.

## 🎯 **Channel Investment Deliberately**

Hype attracts scattershot funding. Apply [Directed Investment](/strategies/attacking/directed-investment) to concentrate resources on experiments that show signal. Fund shared platforms—feature stores, governance tooling, data pipelines—that multiple teams can reuse. Pair investment decisions with map reviews so you can see whether you're building new differentiators or accidentally reinventing commodities that vendors already provide.

## 🗞️ **Communicate the Future State Clearly**

Use the [Press Release Process](/strategies/attacking/press-release-process) to articulate what success looks like before heavy build begins. Draft the narrative, FAQs, and launch metrics that would make the AI initiative newsworthy. This backward planning exposes gaps in user understanding, regulatory posture, or operating model design. Share the press release broadly to align executives, compliance, and delivery teams on the same destination.

## 🧑‍🏫 **Elevate Organisational Literacy**

Most AI programs stall because the workforce is unsure how to use the new capabilities. Launch an [Education](/strategies/user-perception/education) campaign targeted to each role: frontline staff need playbooks, managers need dashboards, and executives need risk primers. Encourage teams to annotate Wardley Maps with doctrine like [Use a Common Language](/doctrines/use-a-common-language) so that data scientists, engineers, and business owners describe evolution in consistent terms.

## ⚙️ **Industrialise What Works**

Once an experiment proves value, shift into a scaling posture. Combine [Market Enablement](/strategies/accelerators/market-enablement) with platform thinking: offer reusable services, guardrails, and compliance templates so other teams can plug in quickly. Where third-party utilities already excel—speech-to-text, document classification—prefer integration over bespoke builds. Reserve custom models for the differentiating slices that map data uniqueness to user delight.

## 📏 **Measure Adoption and Trust**

Track both technical and human signals: deployment frequency, percentage of decisions augmented by AI, model drift incidents, employee confidence scores, and regulatory approvals secured. When metrics degrade, revisit the map to identify whether the issue stems from data quality, process misalignment, or a component that has evolved into a commodity. Continuous sensing keeps the transformation grounded in value rather than novelty.
