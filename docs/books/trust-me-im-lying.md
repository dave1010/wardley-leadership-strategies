# Trust Me, I'm Lying

In **Trust Me, I'm Lying: Confessions of a Media Manipulator**, Ryan Holiday reveals how modern media incentives can be gamed. Drawing on his experience running marketing stunts, he explains how to seed stories in blogs, manufacture outrage, and exploit the viral news cycle.

Holiday also warns about the societal costs of these tactics, showing how misinformation cascades through loosely fact-checked networks. The book is a cautionary manual for anyone considering or countering signal distortion campaigns.
