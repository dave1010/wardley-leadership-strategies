# Strategic Management of Technological Innovation

Melissa A. Schilling's **Strategic Management of Technological Innovation** provides a comprehensive framework for managing innovation portfolios. The text explores technology S-curves, dominant design emergence, innovation diffusion, and the organisational structures required to shepherd ideas from research through commercialisation.

Schilling blends academic research with corporate case studies, showing how firms evaluate timing, invest in complementary assets, and orchestrate partnerships. It is a practical reference for leaders deciding when to pioneer, how to scale, and how to build capabilities that keep innovation pipelines healthy.
