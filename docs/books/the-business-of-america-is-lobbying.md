# The Business of America is Lobbying

Lee Drutman's **The Business of America is Lobbying** analyses how corporate lobbying became a permanent part of the U.S. political system. It traces the growth of influence campaigns, the economics of lobbying firms, and why companies build in-house public affairs capabilities.

Drutman explains how lobbying strategies shape regulation, framing it as a long-term investment rather than episodic activity. The book provides data-driven insight for strategists assessing when regulatory plays can reinforce competitive positions.
