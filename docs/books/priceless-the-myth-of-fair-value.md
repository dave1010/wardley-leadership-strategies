# Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value

William Poundstone's **Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value (and How to Take Advantage of It)** explores behavioural pricing and why perceptions of fairness shape buying decisions. Drawing on experiments in psychology and behavioural economics, it demonstrates anchoring, decoy pricing, and other techniques that influence willingness to pay.

The book helps strategists understand how framing, context, and small design choices affect price acceptance. It is particularly useful for teams aligning pricing policy with user perception dynamics.
