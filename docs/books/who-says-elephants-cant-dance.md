# Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?

**Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?** is Louis V. Gerstner Jr.'s memoir of leading IBM's turnaround in the 1990s. He recounts how the company shifted from a hardware-centric culture to a services-led organisation, describing decisions on cost restructuring, cultural change, and market focus.

Gerstner highlights the importance of confronting reality, aligning incentives, and sustaining momentum amid deep-seated inertia. The narrative offers practical lessons for leaders tasked with reshaping large, legacy enterprises.
