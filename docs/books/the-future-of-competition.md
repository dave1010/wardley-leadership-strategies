# The Future of Competition

C.K. Prahalad and Venkat Ramaswamy's **The Future of Competition: Co-Creating Unique Value with Customers** argues that value creation is shifting from firm-centric offerings to collaborative experiences. The authors illustrate how companies invite customers into design, production, and delivery, using dialogue, access, risk-benefits, and transparency as the DART model for co-creation.

The book provides cases from industries such as automotive, consumer goods, and technology to show how co-creation reshapes business models and relationships. It offers a strategic blueprint for organisations that want to unlock value by partnering deeply with users.
