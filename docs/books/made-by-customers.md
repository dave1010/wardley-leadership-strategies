# Made by Customers

In **Made by Customers: The New Revolution in Creating and Marketing Products**, Stefan Thomke and Eric von Hippel explore how companies harness user innovation. The authors show how customer toolkits, lead-user programmes, and feedback loops let organisations co-design offerings that better meet emerging needs.

The book highlights examples from manufacturing, software, and consumer goods to illustrate how democratised innovation reshapes R&D and marketing processes. It is a helpful reference for teams building co-creation initiatives or community-led product development.
