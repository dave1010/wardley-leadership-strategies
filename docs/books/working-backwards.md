# Working Backwards

**Working Backwards** by Colin Bryar and Bill Carr documents Amazon's leadership principles and product development mechanisms. It details practices like the PR/FAQ process, single-threaded leadership, and metrics-driven operational excellence that enable teams to start with customer outcomes and iterate toward launch.

The book combines anecdotes from Amazon's growth with guidance on how to adopt the mechanisms in other organisations. It stresses writing-driven decision making, rigorous input metrics, and mechanisms for scaling experimentation while preserving customer obsession.
