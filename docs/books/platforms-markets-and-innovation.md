# Platforms, Markets and Innovation

**Platforms, Markets and Innovation** (2009) edited by Annabelle Gawer examines how platform leaders orchestrate ecosystems of complementors. The collection analyses case studies such as Intel, Microsoft, and mobile telecoms to explain how modular architectures, governance choices, and standards battles shape competitive outcomes.

The book highlights strategic levers platform owners use to encourage innovationâ€”ranging from openness policies to API design, pricing, and developer incentives. It provides practical insight into how platform firms balance control with participation and how rivals can challenge an incumbent platform.
