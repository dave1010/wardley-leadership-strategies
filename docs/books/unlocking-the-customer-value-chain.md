# Unlocking the Customer Value Chain

**Unlocking the Customer Value Chain** by Thales S. Teixeira with Greg Piechota explains how disruptive companies decouple stages of the customer journey to win share. Drawing on academic research and case studies (including Amazon, Warby Parker, and Airbnb), it shows how startups exploit friction points in incumbent value chains and then re-bundle services on their own platforms.

The book provides a framework for mapping customer activities, spotting where value can be captured, and sequencing moves from entry to full platform plays. It is especially useful for strategists evaluating disintermediation or direct-to-consumer shifts.
