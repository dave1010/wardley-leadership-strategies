# Competitive Strategy

Michael E. Porter's **Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors** (1980) introduced the Five Forces framework and generic strategies of cost leadership, differentiation, and focus. It equips leaders with analytical tools to evaluate industry structure, anticipate competitor moves, and understand how barriers to entry, supplier power, and substitutes shape profitability.

Porter also explores strategic positioning, capacity expansion decisions, and how to respond to rivals across different competitive arenas. The book remains a foundational reference for crafting offensive and defensive plays in contested markets.
