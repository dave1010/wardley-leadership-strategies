# Differentiate or Die

**Differentiate or Die** by Jack Trout and Steve Rivkin focuses on positioning and the imperative to stand out in crowded markets. The authors outline techniques for carving a unique space in customers' minds, using examples across consumer goods, services, and B2B industries.

They emphasise clarity of message, consistency, and aligning operations with the promised differentiation. The book helps strategists translate differentiation theory into practical brand and product choices.
