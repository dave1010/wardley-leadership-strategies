# Thinking in Bets

In **Thinking in Bets**, former professional poker player Annie Duke explains how to make better decisions under uncertainty. She introduces concepts such as resulting, probabilistic thinking, and decision accountability groups to help leaders separate decision quality from outcomes.

The book provides techniques for constructing scenarios, updating beliefs as new information arrives, and communicating uncertainty without paralysing teams. It is relevant for strategic plays that require timing and judgement in ambiguous environments.
