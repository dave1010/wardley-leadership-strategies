# The Innovator's Dilemma

**The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail** is a book by Clayton M. Christensen.

It introduced the theory of disruptive innovation, explaining how technologies that start out as simpler, cheaper, or lower-performing alternatives can upend industry leaders. Christensen distinguishes sustaining innovations from disruptive ones and advocates for creating autonomous teams to explore disruptive opportunities before competitors do.
