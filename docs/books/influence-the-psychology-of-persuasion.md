# Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion

Robert B. Cialdini's **Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion** distils decades of social psychology research into six principles—reciprocity, commitment, social proof, authority, liking, and scarcity—that explain how people are persuaded. The book uses experiments and real-world stories to reveal how subtle cues shape behaviour.

Cialdini also offers defensive guidance on recognising manipulative tactics and designing ethical influence programmes. For strategists, the work clarifies how narratives and framing can insert ideas into competitors or markets without overt confrontation.
