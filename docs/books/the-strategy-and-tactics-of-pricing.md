# The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing

**The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing** by Thomas T. Nagle, John Hogan, and Joseph Zale offers a structured approach to building and executing pricing strategies. It covers economic foundations, value-based pricing, segmentation, and the organisational processes required to align sales and product teams around price realisation.

The book emphasises practical tools such as price waterfalls, willingness-to-pay analysis, and packaging design. It is widely used by pricing leaders who need to craft bundles, manage discounting discipline, and translate positioning into profitable offers.
