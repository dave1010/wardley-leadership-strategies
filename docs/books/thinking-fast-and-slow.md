# Thinking, Fast and Slow

**Thinking, Fast and Slow** (2011) by Daniel Kahneman synthesises behavioural economics research on how people make judgements under uncertainty. It introduces the dual-system model—fast, intuitive "System 1" thinking and slower, analytical "System 2" reasoning—and shows how cognitive shortcuts shape perception, probability assessments, and risk appetite.

Kahneman outlines biases such as anchoring, availability, and loss aversion, explaining why even experts misread weak signals or overweight recent information. The book offers guidance on structuring decisions, stress-testing assumptions, and building processes that counteract mental shortcuts when stakes are high.
