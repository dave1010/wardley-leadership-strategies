# Confessions of the Pricing Man

In **Confessions of the Pricing Man**, pricing expert Hermann Simon shares stories and frameworks from decades of advising companies on price strategy. He explains value-based pricing, price differentiation, and the psychology behind willingness to pay, illustrating concepts with real client engagements.

Simon emphasises the organisational discipline required to implement pricing decisions, including governance, sales enablement, and measurement. The book is a practitionerâ€™s guide to turning pricing into a growth lever rather than an afterthought.
