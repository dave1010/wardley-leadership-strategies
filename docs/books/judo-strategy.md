# Judo Strategy

In **Judo Strategy**, David B. Yoffie and Mary Kwak analyse how smaller companies can exploit the strength and momentum of incumbents. Using martial arts metaphors and business cases (such as Netscape vs. Microsoft), they describe tactics for rapid movement, leverage, and balance that let challengers turn a giant's size into a liability.

The book covers moves like building alliances, shaping standards, and attacking under-served niches before incumbents can react. It is a tactical manual for entrants attempting to undermine barriers without direct confrontation.
