# The Direct-to-Consumer Playbook

Mike Stevens' **The Direct-to-Consumer Playbook** distils lessons from building and advising DTC brands. It covers positioning, digital acquisition, subscription economics, and the operational foundations needed to serve customers directly without intermediaries.

The book emphasises understanding unit economics, building community, and orchestrating fulfilment and customer service to support recurring relationships. It is a practical manual for leaders planning to bypass traditional channels and own the end-to-end customer experience.
