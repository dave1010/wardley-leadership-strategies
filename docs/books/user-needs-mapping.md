# User Needs Mapping

**User Needs Mapping** by Rich Allen outlines a structured approach to capturing expressed, expected, and future user needs before drawing Wardley Maps, helping teams keep their maps anchored in real demand.

The book focuses on practical prompts and workshop techniques for surfacing needs, sequencing them, and translating that insight into clearer value chains and evolution stages.
