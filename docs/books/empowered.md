# Empowered

**Empowered** (2020) by Marty Cagan and Chris Jones outlines how technology organisations build empowered product teams. It emphasises outcome-focused missions, autonomous squads, and product leadership that provides vision, coaching, and guardrails rather than feature roadmaps.

The authors cover hiring, career paths, discovery practices, and the partnership between product management, design, and engineering. The book serves as a field guide for leaders seeking to create experimentation-driven cultures capable of rapidly iterating on customer problems.
