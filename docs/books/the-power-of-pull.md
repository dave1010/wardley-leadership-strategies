# The Power of Pull

In **The Power of Pull**, John Hagel III, John Seely Brown, and Lang Davison argue that advantage comes from attracting resources, talent, and ideas when needed rather than owning them outright. They describe how digital networks enable organisations to sense opportunities, mobilise ecosystems, and accelerate learning through open flows of knowledge.

The book offers frameworks for cultivating edge initiatives, shaping serendipity, and designing platforms that draw participants into shared problem solving. It is especially relevant for leaders seeking to reposition the centre of gravity of an industry or build communities around their platforms.
