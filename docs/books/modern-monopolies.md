# Modern Monopolies

In **Modern Monopolies**, Alex Moazed and Nicholas L. Johnson examine how platform businesses create and capture value. They explain the economics of multi-sided markets, network effects, and data-driven feedback loops that allow platform companies to outpace traditional linear businesses.

The authors provide case studies from technology, retail, and transportation, outlining strategies for launching platforms, governing ecosystems, and monetising participation. The book is a field guide for leaders building or competing with platform monopolies.
