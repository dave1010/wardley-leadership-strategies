# Leading Change

In **Leading Change**, John P. Kotter presents an eight-step model for delivering successful organisational transformations. The book emphasises establishing urgency, forming guiding coalitions, crafting vision, communicating for buy-in, empowering action, generating wins, consolidating gains, and anchoring new approaches in culture.

Kotter draws on corporate case studies to show why change programmes stall when leaders skip steps or under-invest in communication. It remains a core reference for executives tackling inertia and building momentum for large-scale change initiatives.
