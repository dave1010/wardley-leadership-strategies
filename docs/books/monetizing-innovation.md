# Monetizing Innovation

**Monetizing Innovation** by Madhavan Ramanujam and Georg Tacke focuses on integrating pricing into product innovation. The authors describe how to test willingness to pay early, design offers around monetisation models, and avoid common traps like feature bloat or underpricing breakthroughs.

They provide case studies and interviews showing how companies align product management, marketing, and finance around pricing hypotheses. The book delivers practical tools for building pricing experiments into the product development lifecycle.
