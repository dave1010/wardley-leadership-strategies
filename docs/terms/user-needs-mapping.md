# User Needs Mapping

User needs mapping is the practice of explicitly listing and layering user needs—expressed wants, expected hygiene requirements, and hypothesised future needs—before mapping the value chain. It keeps Wardley Maps anchored on real demand instead of internal assumptions. Rich Allen’s book [User Needs Mapping](/books/user-needs-mapping) provides a practical guide to the method (<BookRef isbn="9798290256436" />).
