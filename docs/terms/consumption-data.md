# Consumption Data

Data gathered from how users interact with and consume a product, service, or platform, often analysed through [customer analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_analytics). Used in 'Sensing Engines' (ILC) to identify patterns, emerging needs, and successful innovations within an ecosystem.
