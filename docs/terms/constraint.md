# Constraint

A limitation or bottleneck within a system, value chain, or market that restricts flow or performance, similar to the focus on constraints in the [theory of constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints). Strategies can involve creating, exploiting, or removing constraints to gain advantage.
