# Moat (Strategic)

Defensive barriers built around a company's core business ("Tower") to protect it from competition, mirroring the idea of an [economic moat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_moat). These can include network effects, high switching costs, economies of scale, brand loyalty, or intellectual property.
