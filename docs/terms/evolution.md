# Evolution

The process by which components change over time, moving from uncertain, rare, and custom-built (Genesis) towards stable, common, and industrialized (Commodity/Utility), similar to a [technology life cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_life_cycle). Wardley Mapping places components along an evolution axis (X-axis) representing this journey.
