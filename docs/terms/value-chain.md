# Value Chain

A visual representation used in Wardley Mapping showing the components required to meet a user need, drawing on the management concept of the [value chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_chain). Components are arranged vertically based on dependency, with user-visible value at the top and foundational elements at the bottom.
