# Innovate-Leverage-Commoditize (ILC)

An ecosystem strategy cycle described by Simon Wardley in his explanation of the [ILC model](https://blog.gardeviance.org/2013/01/ecosystems.html). An organization innovates (or allows others to innovate on its platform), leverages the ecosystem built around it, senses successful patterns, and then commoditizes those patterns into its core offering, repeating the cycle.
