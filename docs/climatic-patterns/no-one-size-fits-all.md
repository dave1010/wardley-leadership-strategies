# [Components] No one size fits all

A system is built from components that sit at different stages of evolution. Experimental parts require freedom to change, while industrialised parts demand stability and efficiency. Because of this mix, a single management or delivery method cannot suit every component.

This is true in software development as much as in purchasing.
Approaches need to vary:

- **Exploratory work** benefits from lightweight, flexible techniques such as Agile.
- **Maturing products** call for practices that reduce waste and measure learning, often associated with Lean thinking.
- **Highâ€‘volume commodities** rely on repeatability and tight control, where methods like Six Sigma shine.

The same variety applies to purchasing, budgeting, and even organisational structure. For any large endeavour, expect to blend multiple approaches rather than forcing everything into one.
