# [Components] Characteristics change

As an activity evolves, its traits shift dramatically. In the early stages it is uncertain, rare, and poorly understood. Over time it becomes commonplace, predictable, and focused on efficiency.

(Salaman & Storey described how these traits morph over time.)
Common transitions include:

- **From exploration to standardisation** – novel ideas turn into everyday products and eventually into utilities.
- **From competitive advantage to cost of doing business** – what once differentiated you becomes merely expected.
- **From pets to cattle** – unique, carefully tended systems eventually become disposable and interchangeable.

No matter the domain, these changes happen when competition exists. Recognising how characteristics alter over time helps determine when to invest in experimentation and when to industrialise.
