Automation no longer stops at single tasks. Systems now handle multi-step outcomes, stitching together decision-making, execution, and follow-up actions without constant human intervention.

As autonomy length grows, people increasingly work by setting intent rather than micromanaging each action. Triggering a capability kicks off cascades of work that would previously have taken teams days or weeks to complete.

Landscapes tilt toward those who can orchestrate these longer chains effectively. The winners govern guardrails, monitor performance, and continually evaluate where human judgement needs to re-enter the loop.
