# Climatic Patterns

Climatic patterns are broad forces that shape markets over time. They tend to play out regardless of any single organisation's actions.

Recognising these trends helps leaders anticipate how landscapes will evolve and adjust strategy before conditions shift.

## Components

Patterns in this category describe how different parts of a system mature and interact as they evolve.

- [Characteristics change](/climatic-patterns/characteristics-change)
- [Components can co-evolve](/climatic-patterns/components-can-co-evolve)
- [Everything evolves](/climatic-patterns/everything-evolves)
- [Evolution consists of multiple waves of diffusion](/climatic-patterns/evolution-consists-of-multiple-waves-of-diffusion-with-many-chasms)
- [No choice on evolution](/climatic-patterns/no-choice-on-evolution)
- [No one size fits all](/climatic-patterns/no-one-size-fits-all)
- [Rates of evolution can vary by ecosystem](/climatic-patterns/rates-of-evolution-can-vary-by-ecosystem)
- [Synthetic labour becomes a commodity](/climatic-patterns/synthetic-labour-becomes-a-commodity)

## Competitors

These patterns explore how moves by rivals can reshape your landscape.

- [Competitors' actions will change the game](/climatic-patterns/competitors-actions-will-change-the-game)
- [Most competitors have poor situational awareness](/climatic-patterns/most-competitors-have-poor-situational-awareness)

## Financial

Financial patterns highlight how value flows and investment cycles influence evolution.

- [Capital flows to new areas of value](/climatic-patterns/capital-flows-to-new-areas-of-value)
- [Creative Destruction](/climatic-patterns/creative-destruction)
- [Efficiency does not mean a reduced spend](/climatic-patterns/efficiency-does-not-mean-a-reduced-spend)
- [Evolution to higher order systems increases local order](/climatic-patterns/evolution-to-higher-order-systems-results-in-increasing-local-order-and-energy-consumption)
- [Future value is inversely proportional to the certainty we have over it](/climatic-patterns/future-value-is-inversely-proportional-to-the-certainty-we-have-over-it)
- [Higher order systems create new sources of value](/climatic-patterns/higher-order-systems-create-new-sources-of-worth)

## Inertia

These patterns show how internal resistance can block necessary change.

- [Inertia can kill an organisation](/climatic-patterns/inertia-can-kill-an-organisation)
- [Past success breeds inertia](/climatic-patterns/past-success-breeds-inertia)

## Prediction

Prediction patterns point to market cycles or signals that help you forecast future shifts.

- [A 'war' causes organisations to evolve](/climatic-patterns/a-war-causes-organisations-to-evolve)
- [Economy has cycles](/climatic-patterns/economy-has-cycles)
- [Evolution consists of multiple diffusion curves](/climatic-patterns/evolution-consists-of-multiple-diffusion-curves)
- [Not everything is random](/climatic-patterns/not-everything-is-random)
- [The less evolved something is the more uncertain it becomes](/climatic-patterns/the-less-evolved-something-is-then-the-more-uncertain-it-becomes)
- [Two different forms of disruption](/climatic-patterns/two-different-forms-of-disruption)
- [You cannot measure evolution over time or adoption](/climatic-patterns/you-cannot-measure-evolution-over-time-or-adoption-you-need-to-embrace-uncertainty)

## Speed

Speed patterns examine the pace of change and how stability affects agility.

- [Change is not always linear](/climatic-patterns/change-is-not-always-linear)
- [Efficiency enables innovation](/climatic-patterns/efficiency-enables-innovation)
- [Evolution of communication mechanisms increases overall speed](/climatic-patterns/evolution-of-communication-mechanisms-can-increase-the-speed-of-evolution-overall-and-the-diffusion-of-a-single-example-of-change)
- [Increased stability of lower order systems boosts agility](/climatic-patterns/increased-stability-of-lower-order-systems-increases-agility-and-speed-of-re-combination)
- [Autonomy length expands](/climatic-patterns/autonomy-length-expands)
- [Shifts from product to utility show punctuated equilibrium](/climatic-patterns/shifts-from-product-to-utility-tend-to-demonstrate-a-punctuated-equilibrium)
